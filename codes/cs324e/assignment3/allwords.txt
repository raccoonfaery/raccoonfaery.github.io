preface
the
awakened
interest
in
supernormal
phenomena
which
has
taken
place
in
recent
years
has
included
in
its
wake
the
absorbing
subject
of
vampirism
yet
there
has
not
been
any
collection
published
of
vampire
stories
which
are
common
to
all
the
five
continents
of
the
globe
the
subject
of
vampirism
is
regarded
more
seriously
today
than
it
was
even
a
decade
since
and
an
attempt
has
been
made
in
this
volume
to
supply
as
far
as
possible
all
the
instances
which
could
be
collected
from
the
various
countries
how
far
a
certain
amount
of
scientific
truth
may
underlie
even
what
may
be
regarded
as
the
most
extravagant
stories
must
necessarily
be
for
the
present
at
any
rate
an
open
question
but
he
would
indeed
be
a
bold
man
who
would
permit
his
scepticism
as
to
the
objective
existence
of
vampires
in
the
past
or
the
possibility
of
vampirism
in
the
future
to
extend
to
a
categorical
denial
if
this
collection
of
stories
helps
even
in
a
slight
degree
to
the
elucidation
of
the
problem

what
is
a
vampire
the
definition
given
in
websters
international
dictionary
is
a
bloodsucking
ghost
or
reanimated
body
of
a
dead
person
a
soul
or
reanimated
body
of
a
dead
person
believed
to
come
from
the
grave
and
wander
about
by
night
sucking
the
blood
of
persons
asleep
causing
their
death
whitneys
century
dictionary
says
that
a
vampire
is
a
kind
of
spectral
body
which
according
to
a
superstition
existing
among
the
slavic
and
other
races
on
the
lower
danube
leaves
the
grave
during
the
night
and
maintains
a
semblance
of
life
by
sucking
the
warm
blood
of
living
men
and
women
while
they
are
asleep
dead
wizards
werwolves
heretics
and
other
outcasts
become
vampires
as
do
also
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
parents
themselves
illegitimate
and
anyone
killed
by
a
vampire
according
to
the
encyclopdia
britannica
the
persons
who
turn
vampires
are
generally
wizards
suicides
and
those
who
come
to
a
violent
end
or
have
been
cursed
by
their
parents
or
by
the
church
but
anyone
may
become
a
vampire
if
an
animal
especially
a
cat
leaps
over
the
corpse
or
a
bird
flies
over
it
among
the
specialists
the
writers
upon
vampire
lore
and
legend
two
definitions
may
be
quotedhurst
who
says
that
a
vampyr
is
a
dead
body
which
continues
to
live
in
the
grave
which
it
leaves
however
by
night
for
the
purpose
of
sucking
the
blood
of
the
living
whereby
it
is
nourished
and
preserved
in
good
condition
instead
of
becoming
decomposed
like
other
dead
bodies
and
scoffern
who
wrote
the
best
definition
i
can
give
of
a
vampire
is
a
living
mischievous
and
murderous
dead
body
a
living
dead
body
the
words
are
idle
contradictory
incomprehensible
but
so
are
vampires
vampires
says
the
learned
zopfius
come
out
of
their
graves
in
the
night
time
rush
upon
people
sleeping
in
their
beds
suck
out
all
their
blood
and
destroy
them
they
attack
men
women
and
children
sparing
neither
age
nor
sex
those
who
are
under
the
malignity
of
their
influence
complain
of
suffocation
and
a
total
deficiency
of
spirits
after
which
they
soon
expire
some
of
them
being
asked
at
the
point
of
death
what
is
the
matter
with
them
their
answer
is
that
such
persons
lately
dead
rise
to
torment
them
not
all
vampires
however
are
or
were
suckers
of
blood
some
according
to
the
records
despatched
their
victims
by
inflicting
upon
them
contagious
diseases
or
strangling
them
without
drawing
blood
or
causing
their
speedy
or
retarded
death

various
other

p
state
that
a
vampire
according
to
the
view
of
sakai
of
perak
is
not
a
demoneven
though
it
is
incidentally
socalledbut
a
being
of
flesh
and
blood
and
support
this
view
by
the
statement
that
the
vampire
cannot
pass
through
walls
and
hedges
the
word

dutch
vampyr
polish
wampior
or
upior
slownik
upir
ukraine
upeer
is
held
by
skeat
to
be
derived
from
the
servian
wampira
the
russians
morlacchians
inhabitants
of
montenegro
bohemians
servians
arnauts
both
of
hydra
and
albania
know
the
vampire
under
the
name
of
wukodalak
vurkulaka
or
vrykolaka
a
word
which
means
wolffairy
and
is
thought
by
some
to
be
derived
from
the
greek
in
crete
where
slavonic
influence
has
not
been
felt
the
vampire
is
known
by
the
name
of
katakhan
vampire
lore
is
in
general
confined
to
stories
of
resuscitated
corpses
of
male
human
beings
though
amongst
the
malays
a
penangglan
or
vampire
is
a
living
witch
who
can
be
killed
if
she
can
be
caught
in
the
act
of
witchery
she
is
especially
feared
in
houses
where
a
birth
has
taken
place
and
it
is
the
custom
to
hang
up
a
bunch
of
thistle
in
order
to
catch
her
she
is
said
to
keep
vinegar
at
home
to
aid
her
in
reentering
her
own
body
in
the
malay
peninsula
parts
of
polynesia
and
the
neighbouring
districts
the
vampire
is
conceived
as
a
head
with
entrails
attached
which
comes
forth
to
suck
the
blood
of
living
human
beings
in
transylvania
the
belief
prevails
that
every
person
killed
by
a
nosferatu
vampire
becomes
in
turn
a
vampire
and
will
continue
to
suck
the
blood
of
other
innocent
people
until
the
evil
spirit
has
been
exorcised
either
by
opening
the
grave
of
the
suspected
person
and
driving
a
stake
through
the
corpse
or
firing
a
pistolshot
into
the
coffin
in
very
obstinate
cases
it
is
further
recommended
to
cut
off
the
head
fill
the
mouth
with
garlic
and
then
replace
the
head
in
its
proper
place
in
the
coffin
or
else
to
extract
the
heart
and
burn
it
and
strew
the
ashes
over
the
grave
the
murony
of
the
wallachians
not
only
sucks
blood
but
also
possesses
the
power
of
assuming
a
variety
of
shapes
as
for
instance
those
of
a
cat
dog
flea
or
spider
in
consequence
of
which
the
ordinary
evidence
of
death
caused
by
the
attack
of
a
vampire
viz
the
mark
of
a
bite
in
the
back
of
the
neck
is
not
considered
indispensable
the
wallachians
have
a
very
great
fear
of
sudden
death
greater
perhaps
than
any
other
people
for
they
attribute
sudden
death
to
the
attack
of
a
vampire
and
believe
that
anyone
destroyed
by
a
vampire
must
become
a
vampire
and
that
no
power
can
save
him
from
this
fate
a
similar
belief
obtains
in
northern
albania
where
it
is
also
held
that
a
wandering
spirit
has
power
to
enter
the
body
of
any
individual
guilty
of
undetected
crime
and
that
such
obsession
forms
part
of
his
punishment
some
writers
have
ascribed
the
origin
of
the
belief
in
vampires
to
greek
christianity
but
there
are
traces
of
the
superstition
and
belief
at
a
considerably
earlier
date
than
this
in
the
opinion
of
the
anthropologist
tylor
the
shortest
way
of
treating
the
belief
is
to
refer
it
directly
to
the
principles
of
savage
animism
we
shall
see
that
most
of
its
details
fall
into
their
places
at
once
and
that
vampires
are
not
mere
creations
of
groundless
fancy
but
causes
conceived
in
spiritual
form
to
account
for
specific
facts
of
wasting
disease
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
practice
of
offering
up
living
animals
as
sacrifices
to
satisfy
the
thirst
of
departed
human
beings
combined
with
the
ideas
of
the
platonist
and
the
teachings
of
the
learned
jew
isaac
arbanel
who
maintained
that
before
the
soul
can
be
loosed
from
the
fetters
of
the
flesh
it
must
lie
some
months
with
it
in
the
grave
may
have
influenced
the
belief
and
assisted
its
development
vampirism
found
a
place
in
babylonian
belief
and
in
the
folklore
and
traditions
of
many
countries
of
the
near
east
the
belief
was
quite
common
in
arabia
although
there
is
no
trace
of
it
there
in
prechristian
times
the
earliest
references
to
vampires
are
found
in
chaldean
and
assyrian
tablets
later
the
pagan
romans
gave
their
adherence
to
the
belief
that
the
dead
bodies
of
certain
people
could
be
allured
from
their
graves
by
sorcerers
unless
the
bodies
had
actually
undergone
decomposition
and
that
the
only
means
of
effectually
preventing
such
resurrections
was
by
cremating
the
remains
in
grecian
lore
there
are
many
wonderful
stories
of
the
dead
rising
from
their
graves
and
feasting
upon
the
blood
of
the
young
and
beautiful
from
greece
and
rome
the
superstition
spread
throughout
austria
hungary
lorraine
poland
roumania
iceland
and
even
to
the
british
isles
reaching
its
height
in
the
period
from
to
when
a
vampire
fever
or
epidemic
broke
out
in
the
southeast
of
europe
particularly
in
hungary
and
servia
the
belief
in
vampires
even
spread
to
africa
where
the
kaffirs
held
that
bad
men
alone
live
a
second
time
and
try
to
kill
the
living
by
night
according
to
a
local
superstition
of
the
lesbians
the
unquiet
ghost
of
the
virgin
gello
used
to
haunt
their
island
and
was
supposed
to
cause
the
deaths
of
young
children
various
devices
have
been
resorted
to
in
different
countries
at
the
time
of
burial
in
the
belief
that
the
dead
could
thus
be
prevented
from
returning
to
earthlife
in
some
instances
eg
among
the
wallachians
a
long
nail
was
driven
through
the
skull
of
the
corpse
and
the
thorny
stem
of
a
wild
rosebush
laid
upon
the
body
in
order
that
its
shroud
might
become
entangled
with
it
should
it
attempt
to
rise
the
kroats
and
slavonians
burned
the
straw
upon
which
the
suspected
body
lay
they
then
locked
up
all
the
cats
and
dogs
for
if
these
animals
stepped
over
the
corpse
it
would
assuredly
return
as
a
vampire
and
suck
the
blood
of
the
village
folk
many
held
that
to
drive
a
white
thorn
stake
through
the
dead
body
rendered
the
vampire
harmless
and
the
peasants
of
bukowina
still
retain
the
practice
of
driving
an
ash
stake
through
the
breasts
of
suicides
and
supposed
vampiresa
practice
common
in
england
so
far
as
suicides
were
concerned
until
when
there
was
passed
an
act
to
alter
and
amend
the
law
relating
to
the
interment
of
the
remains
of
any
person
found
felo
de
se
in
which
it
was
enacted
that
the
coroner
or
other
officer
shall
give
directions
for
the
private
interment
of
the
remains
of
such
person
felo
de
se
without
any
stake
being
driven
through
the
body
of
such
person
it
was
also
ordained
that
the
burial
was
only
to
take
place
between
nine
and
twelve
oclock
at
night
the
driving
of
a
stake
through
the
body
does
not
seem
to
have
had
always
the
desired
effect
de
schartz
in
his
magia
postuma
published
at
olmutz
in
tells
of
a
shepherd
in
the
village
of
blow
near
kadam
in
bohemia
who
made
several
appearances
after
his
death
and
called
certain
persons
who
never
failed
to
die
within
eight
days
of
such
call
the
peasants
of
blow
took
up
the
body
and
fixed
it
to
the
ground
by
means
of
a
stake
driven
through
the
corpse
the
man
when
in
that
condition
told
them
that
they
were
very
good
to
give
him
a
stick
with
which
he
could
defend
himself
against
the
dogs
which
worried
him
notwithstanding
the
stake
he
got
up
again
that
same
night
alarmed
many
people
and
presumably
out
of
revenge
strangled
more
people
in
that
one
night
than
he
had
ever
done
on
a
single
occasion
before
it
was

was

to
see
that
the
remains
were
burned
outside
the
village
when
the
executioner
and
his
assistants
attempted
to
move
the
corpse
for
that
purpose
it
howled
like
a
madman

moved
its
feet
and
hands
as
though
it
were
alive
they
then
pierced
the
body
through
with
stakes

he
again
uttered
loud
cries
and
a
great
quantity
of
bright
vermilion
blood
flowed
from
him

cremation

an
end

says
that
the
only
remedy
for
these
apparitions
is
to
cut
off
the
heads
and
burn
the
bodies
of
those
who
come
back
to
haunt
their
former
abodes
it
was
however
customary
to
hold
a
public
inquiry
and
examination
of
witnesses
before
proceeding
to
the
burning
of
a
body
and
if
upon
examination
of
the
body
it
was
found
that
the
corpse
had
begun
to
decompose
that
the
limbs
were
not
supple
and
mobile
and
the
blood
not
fluidic
then
burning
was
not
commanded
even
in
the
case
of
suspected
persons
an
interval
of
six
to
seven
weeks
was
always
allowed
to

the

was
opened
in

he

people
in
the
neighbourhood
killed
people
while
they
were
engaged
in
their
occupations
and
played
so
many
mischievous
pranks
that

inhabitants
began
to
move
away

man
named

took
courage
and
ran
at
the

with
a
lance
which
he
drove
into
the
apparition
the
spectre
instantly
vanished
taking
the

with
it

had
the
grave

opened

he
found
the
lance
in
the
dead
body
which
had
not
become
corrupted
the
corpse
was
then
taken
from
the
grave
burned
and
the
ashes
thrown
into
the
sea
and
the
spectre
did
not
afterwards
trouble
the
inhabitants
to
cross
the
arms
of
the
corpse

in
some

regarded
as

preventive
of

will
be

that
it
was
at
one
time
the
practice
in
england
to
bury
suicides
at
the
four
crossroads
if
a
vampire
should
make
its
appearance
it
could
be
prevented
from
ever
appearing
again
by
forcing
it
to
take
the
oath
not
to
do
so
if
the
words
by
my
windingsheet
were
incorporated
in
the
oath
one
charm
employed
by
the
wallachians
to
prevent
a
person
becoming
a
vampire
was
to
rub
the
body
in
certain
parts
with
the
lard
of
a
pig
killed
on
st

and
russia
vampires
make
their
appearance
from
noon
to
midnight
instead
of
between
nightfall
and
dawn
the
rule
that
generally
prevails
they
come
and
suck
the
blood
of
living
men
and
animals
in
such
abundance
that
sometimes
it
flows
from
them
at
the
nose
and
ears
and
occasionally
in
such
profusion
that
the
corpse
swims
in
the
blood
thus
oozing
from
it
as
it
lies
in
the
coffin
one
may
become
immune
from
the
attacks
of
vampires
by
mixing
this
blood
with
flour
and
making
bread
from
the
mixture
a
portion
of
which
must
be
eaten
otherwise
the
charm
will
not
work
the
californians
held
that
the
mere
breaking
of
the
spine
of
the
corpse
was
sufficient
to
prevent
its
return
as
a
vampire
sometimes
heavy
stones
were
piled
on
the
grave
to
keep

their
life

be

for
a
time
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
that
the
soul
should
get
what
it
desires
as
if
not
satisfied
it
might
come

it
is
possible
that
the
bodily
mutilations
which
to
this
day
accompany
funerals
among
some
peoples
have
their
origin
in
the
belief
that
the
departed
spirit
is
refreshed
by
the
blood
thus
spilt
the
samoans
called
it
an
offering
of
blood
for
the
dead

the
mourners
beat
their
heads

part
of
the
ceremony

initiation

in
drinking
in
a
church
before
the
commencement
of
mass

a
flask
filled
with
blood
taken
from
the
corpses
of
murdered
infants
the
methods
employed
for
the
detection
of
vampires
have
varied
according
to
the
countries
in
which
the
belief
in
their
existence
was
maintained
in
some
places
it
was
held
that
if
there
were

in
a
grave
two
or
three
or
more
holes
about
the
size
of
a
mans
finger
it
would
almost
certainly
follow
that
a
body
with
all
the
marks
of
vampirism
would
be
discovered
within
the
grave
the
wallachians
employed
a
rather
elaborate
method
of
divination
they
were
in
the
habit
of
choosing
a
boy
young
enough
to
make
it
certain
that
he
was
innocent
of
any
impurity
he
was
then
placed
on
an
absolutely
black
and
unmutilated
horse
which
had
never
stumbled
the
horse
was
then
made
to
ride
about
the
cemetery
and
pass
over
all
the
graves
if
the
horse
refused
to
pass
over
any
grave
even
in
spite
of
repeated
blows
that
grave
was
believed
to
shelter
a
vampire
their
records
state
that
when
such
a
grave
was
opened
it
was
generally
found
to
contain
a
corpse
as
fat
and
handsome
as
that
of
a
fullblooded
man
quietly
sleeping
the
finest
vermilion
blood
would
flow
from
the
throat
when
cut
and
this
was
held
to
be
the
blood
he
had
sucked
from
the
veins
of
living
people
it
is
said
that
the
attacks
of
the
vampire
generally
ceased
on
this
being
done
in
the
town
of
perlepe

monastru
and
kiuprili

existed
the
extraordinary
phenomenon
of
a
number
of
families
who
were
regarded
as
being
the
offspring
of
vrykolakas

as
possessing
the
power
of
laying
the
wandering
spirits
to
which
they
were
related
they
are
said
to
have
kept
their
art
very
dark
and
to
have
practised
it
in
secret
but
their
fame
was
so
widely
spread
that
persons
in
need
of
such
deliverance
were
accustomed
to
send
for
them
from
other
cities
in
ordinary
life
and
intercourse
they
were
avoided
by
all
the
inhabitants
although
some
writers
have
contended
that
no
vampire
has
yet
been
caught
in
the
act
of
vampirism
and
that
as
no
museum

natural
history

secured
a
specimen

whole
of
the
stories
concerning
vampires

from
the
law
of
dissolution
of
the
mortal
remains
until
the
church
granted
release
from
the
curse
entailed
upon
them
by
such
act
the
priests
by
this
assumption
of
power
over
the
body
as
well
as
over
the
soul
made
profitable
use
of
this
superstitious
belief
by
preying
upon
the
fears
and
credulity
of
the
living
they
also
included
in
this
ecclesiastical
law
of
exemption
from
corruption
after
death
those
who
in
their
lives
had
been
guilty
of
heinous
sins
those
who
had
tampered
with
the
magic
arts
and
all
who
had
been
cursed
during
life
by
their
parents
these
were
all
said
to
become
vampires
this
belief
spread
to
other
branches
of
the
christian
church
and
the
story
is
related
that
st
libentius
archbishop
of
bremen
who
died
th
january
once
excommunicated
a
gang
of
pirates
one
of
whom
died
shortly
afterwards
and
was
buried
in
norway
seventy
years
afterwards
his
body
was
found
quite
entire
and
uncorrupted
nor
did
it
fall
to
ashes
until
it
had
received
absolution
from
the
bishop
alvareda
leo
allatius
a
roman
catholic
describes
a
corpse
which
he
found
in
an
undecomposed
condition
he
implies
that
the
greeks
connected
the
circumstance
with
the
power
invested
in
them
by
the
text
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
by
which
they
hold
that
the
soul
is
excluded
from
all
hope
of
participation
in
future
bliss
so
long
as
the

remains
undecomposed
poqueville
another
writer
also
states
that
whenever
a
bishop
or
priest
excommunicated
a
person
he
added
to
the
general
sentence
of
excommunication
the
words

death

a
manuscript
was
discovered
many
years
ago
in
the
church
of
st
sophia
at
thessalonica
which
is
an
interesting
commentary
upon
the
power
claimed
by
the
church
over
excommunicated
bodies
the
manuscript
states
that
whoever
has
been
laid
under
any
curse
or
received
any
injunction
from
his
deceased
parents
that
he
has
not
fulfilled
after
his
death
the
forepart
of
his
body
remains
entire
whoever
has
been
the
object
of
any
anathema
appears
yellow
after
death
and
the
fingers
are
shrivelled
whoever
appears
white
has
been
excommunicated
by
the
divine
laws
whoever
appears
black
has
been
excommunicated
by
a
bishop
it
was
held
possible
to
discover
by
means
of
these
signs
the
crime
for
which
as
well
as
the
person
on
whom
the
judgment
had
been
pronounced
one
horrible
result
of
this
ghastly
superstition
was
the
custom
which
was
at
one
time
prevalent
among
the
greeks
of
salonica
as
well
as
the
bulgarians
in
the
centre
of
european
turkey
and
other
nations
of
disinterring
indiscriminately
the
bodies
of
the
dead
after
they
had
been
buried
for
twelve
months
in
order
to
ascertain
from
the
condition
of
the
remains
whether
the
souls
were
in
heaven
or
hell
or
perambulating
the
neighbourhood
as
vampires
this
assumed
ecclesiastical
power
acted
occasionally
however
injuriously
on
the
clergy
themselves
there
is
on
record
one
instance
where
a
priest
was
killed
in
revenge
for
the
death
of
a
man
whose
illness
was
attributed
to
the
sentence
of
excommunication
that
had
been
passed
upon
him
on
another
occasion
a
bishop
of
some
diocese
in
morea
was
robbed
by
a
band
of
brigands
as
he
was
passing
through
a
portion
of
the
maniate
territory
when
the
deed
was
done
the
mountaineers
bethought
themselves
that
the
bishop
would
in
all
probability
excommunicate
them
as
soon
as
he
reached
a
place
of
safety
they
saw
no
means
of
averting
this
to
them
dreadful
calamity
except
by
the
committal
of
a
further
and
more
heinous
crime
and
so
they
set
out
in
pursuit
of
the
unfortunate
bishop
whom
they
eventually
overtook
and
murdered
many
years
ago
a
greek
of
keramia
complained
to
the
pasha
of
khania
that
the
paps
of
his
village
had
excommunicated
him
and
so
been
the
indirect
cause
of
his
having
been
bewitched
the
pasha
sent
for
the
priest
threw
him
into
prison
and
only
released
him
upon
payment
of
a
fine
of
piastres
during
a
local
war
a
native
of
theriso
was
taken
ill
the
cry
went
up
it
is
an
aphorismos
the
paps
was
accused
reviled
and
threatened
with
murder
unless
the
curse
was
removed
but
the
man
continued
to
get
worse
and
eventually
died
so
firm
was
the
belief
of
everyone
in
the
neighbourhood
that
the
ban
had
caused
the
mans
death
that
some
of
his
companions
regarded
it
as
a
duty
to
avenge
his
fate
and
in
consequence
they
sought
out
the
priest
and
shot
him
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
metropolitan
of
larissa
was
informed
that
a
paps
had
disinterred
two
bodies
and
thrown
them
into
the
halimon
on
pretence
of
their
being
vruklakas
upon
being
summoned
before
the
bishop
the
priest
admitted
the
truth
of
the
accusation
and
justified
his
act
by
saying
that
a
report
had
been
current
that
a
large
animal
accompanied
with
flames
had
been
seen
to
issue
from
the
grave
in
which
these
two
bodies
had
been
buried
the
bishop
fined
the
priest
piastres
and
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
the
diocese
that
in
future
similar
offences
would
be
punished
with
double
that
fine
and
be
accompanied
with
loss
of
position
martin
crusius
tells
the
following
curious
story
there
were
about
the
court
of
mahomet
ii
a
number
of
men
learned
in
greek
and
arabic
literature
who
had
investigated
a
variety
of
points
connected
with
the
christian
faith
they
informed
the
sultan
that
the
bodies
of
persons
excommunicated
by
the
greek
clergy
did
not
decompose
and
when
he
inquired
whether
the
effect
of
absolution
was
to
dissolve
them
he
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
upon
this
he
sent
orders
to
maximus
the
patriarch
of
that
period
to
produce
a
case
by
which
the
truth
of
the
statement
might
be
tested
the
patriarch
convened
his
clergy
in
great
trepidation
and
after
long
deliberation
they
ascertained
that
a
woman
had
been
excommunicated
by
the
previous
patriarch
for
the
commission
of
grievous
sins
they
ascertained
the
whereabouts
of
her
grave
and
when
they
had
opened
it
they
found
that
the
corpse
was
entire
but
swollen
out
like
a
drum
when
the
news
of
this
reached
the
sultan
he
despatched
some
of
his
officers
to
possess
themselves
of
the
body
which
they
did
and
deposited
it
in
a
safe
place
on
an
appointed
day
the
liturgy
was
said
over
it
and
the
patriarch
recited
the
absolution
in
the
presence
of
the
officials
as
this
was
being
donewonderful
to
relatethe
bones
were
heard
to
rattle
as
they
fell
apart
in
the
coffin
and
at
the
same
time
the
narrator
adds
the
womans
soul
was
also
freed
from
the
punishment
to
which
it
had
been
condemned
the
courtiers
at
once
ran
and
informed
the
sultan
who
was
astonished
at
the
miracle
and
exclaimed
of
a
surety
the
christian
religion
is
true
calmet
also
relates
this
story
and
adds
that
the
body
was
found
to
be
entirely
black
and
much
swollen
that
it
was
placed
in
a
chest
under
the
emperors
seal
which
chest
was
not
opened
until
three
days
after
the
absolution
had
been
pronounced
when
the
body
was
seen
to
be
reduced
to
ashes
during
the
long
war
between
the
christians
and
mohammedans
in
the
island
of
crete
it
became
a
matter
of
astonishment
that
ravages
caused
by
vampires
were
no
longer
the
subject
of
conversation
how
can
it
be
when
the
number
of
deaths
is
so
great
that
none
of
those
that
die
become
katakhans
was
the
question
asked
to
be
met
with
the
answer
no
one
ever
becomes
a
katakhan
if
he
dies
in
time
of
war
leo
allatius
also
relates
that
he
was
told
by
athanasius
metropolitan
of
imbros
that
on
one
occasion
being
earnestly
entreated
to
pronounce
the
absolution
over
a
number
of
corpses
that
had
long
remained
undecomposed
he
consented
to
do
so
and
before
the
recitation
was
concluded
they
all
fell
away
into
ashes
rycaut
relates
a
similar
occurrence
to
which
he
appends
the
following
remark
this
story
i
should
not
have
judged
worth
relating
but
that
i
heard
it
from
the
mouth
of
a
grave
person
who
says
that
his
own
eyes
were
witnesses
thereof
the
hydhrans
or
hydhrioks
say
there
used
to
be
a
great
number
of
vampires
in
hydhra
and
that
their
present
freedom
is
to
be
attributed
solely
to
the
exertions
of
their
bishop
who
banished
them
all
to
santorhe
where
on
the
desert
isle
they
now
exist
in
great
numbers
wandering
about
rolling
stones
down
the
slope
towards
the
sea
as
may
be
heard
by
anyone
who
passes
near
in
a
kak
during
the
night
at
the
second
council
of
limoges
held
in
the
bishop
of
cahors
made
the
following
statement
a
knight
of
my
diocese
being
killed
in
a
state
of
excommunication
i
refused
to
comply
with
the
request
of
his
friends
who
solicited
me
earnestly
to
give
him
absolution
my
resolution
was
to
make
an
example
of
him
in
order
to
strike
terror
into
others
notwithstanding
this
he
was
buried
in
a
church
dedicated
to
st
peter
by
some
soldiers
or
knights
without
any
ecclesiastical
ceremony
without
any
leave
and
without
the
assistance
of
any
priest
the
next
morning
his
body
was
found
out
of
the
grave
perfectly
entire
and
without
any
token
of
its
having
been
touched
the
soldiers
who
buried
him
opened
the
grave
and
found
nothing
but
the
linen
which
had
been
wrapped
about
his
body
they
then
buried
him
afresh
and
covered
the
grave
with
an
enormous
quantity
of
earth
and
stones
the
next
day
the
corpse
was
found
out
of
the
grave
again
and
there
were
no
symptoms
of
anyone
having
been
at
work
the
same
thing
was
repeated
five
times
and
at
last
they
buried
him
in
unconsecrated
ground
at
a
distance
from
the
churchyard
when
no
further
incident
occurred
rycaut
states
that
the
following
story
was
related
to
him
with
many
asseverations
of
truth
by
a
grave
candive
kalois
called
sofronio
a
preacher
and
a
person
of
no
mean
repute
and
learning
at
smyrna
i
knew
he
said
a
certain
person
who
for
some
misdemeanours
committed
in
the
morea
fled
over
to
the
isle
of
milo
where
though
he
escaped
the
hand
of
justice
he
could
not
avoid
the
sentence
of
excommunication
from
which
he
could
no
more
fly
than
from
the
conviction
of
his
own
conscience
or
the
guilt
which
ever
attended
him
for
the
fatal
hour
of
his
death
being
come
and
the
sentence
of
the
church
not
revoked
the
body
was
carelessly
and
without
solemnity
interred
in
some
retired
and
unfrequented
place
in
the
meantime
the
relatives
of
the
deceased
were
much
afflicted
and
anxious
for
the
sad
estate
of
their
dead
friend
whilst
the
peasants
and
islanders
were
every
night
affrighted
and
disturbed
with
strange
and
unusual
apparitions
which
they
immediately
concluded
arose
from
the
grave
of
the
accursed
excommunicant
which
according
to
their
custom
they
immediately
opened
when
they
found
the
body
uncorrupted
ruddy
and
the
veins
replete
with
blood
the
coffin
was
furnished
with
grapes
apples
and
nuts
and
such
fruits
as
the
season
afforded
whereupon
consultation
being
taken
the
kaloires
resolved
to
make
use
of
the
common
remedy
in
those
cases
which
was
to
cut
and
dismember
the
body
into
several
parts
and
to
boil
it
in
wine
as
the
approved
means
of
dislodging
the
evil
spirit
and
disposing
the
body
to
a
dissolution
but
the
friends
of
the
deceased
being
willing
and
desirous
that
the
corpse
should
rest
in
peace
and
some
ease
given
to
the
departed
soul
obtained
a
reprieve
from
the
clergy
and
hoped
that
for
a
sum
of
money
they
being
persons
of
a
competent
estate
a
release
might
be
purchased
from
the
excommunication
under
the
hand
of
the
patriarch
in
this
manner
the
corpse
was
for
a
little
while
freed
from
dissection
and
letters
thereupon
sent
to
constantinople
with
this
direction
that
in
case
the
patriarch
should
condescend
to
take
off
the
excommunication
that
the
day
hour
and
minute
that
he
signed
the
remission
should
be
inserted
in
the
document
and
now
the
corpse
was
taken
into
the
church
the
country
people
not
being
willing
it
should
remain
in
the
field
and
prayers
and
masses
were
daily
said
for
its
dissolution
and
the
pardon
of
the
offender
when
one
day
after
many
prayers
supplications
and
offerings
as
this
sofrino
attested
to
me
with
many
protestations
and
whilst
he
himself
was
heard
performing
divine
service
on
a
sudden
was
heard
a
rumbling
noise
in
the
coffin
of
the
dead
party
to
the
fear
and
astonishment
of
all
persons
then
present
which
when
they
had
opened
they
found
the
body
consumed
and
dissolved
as
far
into
its
first
principles
of
earth
as
if
it
had
been
several
years
interred
the
hour
and
minute
of
this
dissolution
was
immediately
noted
and
precisely
observed
which
being
compared
with
the
date
of
the
patriarchs
release
when
it
was
signed
at
constantinople
it
was
found
exactly
to
agree
with
that
moment
in
which
the
body
returned
to
its
ashes
in
most
countries
the
vampire
was
regarded
as
a
nightwanderer
but
resting
in
its
grave
on
friday
night
so
that
the
ceremony
of
absolution
had
to
be
performed
on
that
night
or
during
saturday
because
if
the
spirit
was
out
on
its
rambles
when
the
ceremony
took
place
it
was
unavailing
the
sfakians
generally
believe
that
the
ravages
committed
by
these
nightwanderers
used
in
former
times
to
be
far
more
frequent
than
they
are
at
the
present
day
and
that
they
have
become
comparatively
rare
solely
in
consequence
of
the
increased
zeal
and
skill
possessed
by
members
of
the
sacerdotal
order
tournefort
relates
an
entertaining
story
of
a
vampire
that
woefully
annoyed
the
inhabitants
of
myconi
prayers
processions
stabbing
with
swords
sprinklings
of
holy
water
and
even
pouring
the
latter
in
large
quantities
down
the
throat
of
the
refractory
vroucolaca
were
all
tried
in
vain
an
albanian
who
chanced
to
be
at
myconi
objected
to
two
of
these
remedies
it
was
no
wonder
the
devil
continued
in
he
said
for
how
could
he
possibly
come
through
the
holy
water
and
as
to
swords
they
were
equally
effectual
in
preventing
his
exit
for
their
handles
being
crosses
he
was
so
much
terrified
that
he
dare
not
pass
them
to
obviate
the
latter
objection
he
recommended
that
turkish
scymetars
should
be
used
the
scymetars
were
accordingly
put
in
requisition
but
the
pertinacious
devil
still
retained
his
hold
of
the
corpse
and
played
his
pranks
with
as
much
vigour
as
ever
at
length
when
all
the
respectable
inhabitants
were
packing
up
to
take
flight
to
syra
or
tinos
an
effectual
method
of
ousting
the
vroucolaca
was
fortunately
suggested
the
body
was
committed
to
the
flames
on
january
st
and
the
spirit
being
thus
forcibly
ejected
from
its
abode
was
rendered
incapable
of
doing
further
mischief

is
a
story
told
of
st
stanislaus
raising
to
life
a
man
who
had
been
dead
for
three
years
whom
he
called
to
life
in
order
that
he
might
give
evidence
on
the
saints
behalf
in
a
court
of
justice
after
having
given
his
evidence

man
returned
quietly
to
his
grave
chapter
iii
the
vampire
in
babylonia
assyria
and
greece
the
belief
in
the
vampire
and
ghoul
was
prevalent
even
in
babylon
and
assyria
where
it
was
maintained
that
the
dead
could
appear
again
upon
earth
and
seek
sustenance
from
the
living
the
belief
is
in
all
probability
linked
up
with
the
almost
universal
theory
that
transfused
blood
is
necessary
for
revivification
baths
of
human
blood
were
anciently
prescribed
as
a
possible
remedy
for
leprosy
mr
r
campbell
thompson
in
his
work
the
devils
and
evil
spirits
of
babylonia
states
that
the
ekimmu
or
departed
spirit
was
the
soul
of
the
dead
person
unable
to
rest
which
wandered
as
a
spectre
over
the
earth
if
it
found
a
luckless
man
who
had
wandered
far
from
his
fellows
into
haunted
places
it
fastened
upon
him
plaguing
and
tormenting
him
until
such
time
as
a
priest
should
drive
it
away
with
exorcisms

the

greek
christianity
as
already
stated
has
been
credited
by
many
with
the
origin
of
the
vampire
belief
but
this
contention
is
hardly
borne
out
by
facts
the
belief
was
undoubtedly
developed
greatly
under
the
influence
of
the
greek
church
and
utilised
by
the
greek
priests
as
an
additional
power
which
they
possessed
over
the
people
it
did
not
become
prominent
in
greece
until
after
the
establishment
of
christianity
and
there
are
many
remarkable
stories
told
of
vampire
apparitions
among
the
slavonic
races
bordering
on
greece
as
well
as
among
the
arabians
in
later
times
father
richard
a
french
jesuit
of
the
seventeenth
century
went
as
a
missionary
to
the
archipelago
and
has
left
an
account
of
the
islands
of
santerini
in
which
he
discourses
at
length
upon
the
bucolacs
or
vampires
of
that
district
some
greeks
believe
that
the
spectre
which
appears
is
not
really
the
soul
of
the
deceased
but
an
evil
spirit
which
enters
his
body
after
the
soul
of
the
owner
has
been
withdrawn
thus
leo
allatius
in
describing
the
belief
says
the
corpse
is
entered
by
a
demon
which
is
the
source
of
ruin
to
unhappy
men
for
frequently
emerging
from
the
tomb
in
the
form
of
that
body
and
roaming
about
the
city
and
other
inhabited
places
especially
by
night
it
betakes
itself
to
any
house
it
fancies
and
after
knocking
at
the
door
addresses
one
of
the
inmates
in
a
loud
tone
if
the
person
answers
he
is
done
for
two
days
after
that
he
dies
if
he
does
not
answer
he
is
safe
in
consequence
of
this
all
the
people
in
chios
if
anyone
calls
to
them
by
night
never
reply
the
first
time
for
if
a
second
call
is
given
they
know
that
it
does
not
proceed
from
the
vrykolaka
but
from
someone
else
in
the
menes
des
grecs
it
is
recorded
that
an
ecclesiastic
of
scheti
being
excommunicated
by
his
superior
for
some
act
of
disobedience
quitted
the
desert
and
came
to
alexandria
where
he
was
apprehended
by
the
governor
of
the
city
stripped
of
his
religious
habit
and
strongly
solicited
to
sacrifice
to
the
idols
of
the
place
the
man
bravely
resisted
the
temptation
and
was
tortured
in
several
ways
till
at
last
they
cut
off
his
head
and
threw
his
body
out
of
the
city
to
be
devoured
by
dogs
the
next
night
it
was
carried
away
by
the
christians
who
having
embalmed
it
and
wrapped
it
up
in
fine
linen
interred
it
in
an
honourable
part
of
the
church
with
all
the
respect
due
to
the
remains
of
a
martyr
but
at
the
next
celebration
of
the
mass
upon
the
deacons
crying
out
aloud
as
usual
let
the
catechumens
and
all
who
do
not
communicate
retire
his
grave
instantly
opened
and
the
martyr
retired
into
the
church
porch
when
mass
was
over
he
came
again
of
his
own
accord
into
the
grave
not
long
afterwards
it
was
revealed
by
an
angel
to
a
holy
person
who
had
continued
three
days
in
prayer
that
the
deceased
ecclesiastic
had
been
excommunicated
by
his
superior
and
would
continue
bound
till
that
same
superior
had
reversed
the
sentence
upon
this
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
the
desert
after
the
holy
anchorite
who
ordered
the
grave
to
be
opened
and
absolved
the
deceased
who
after
this
continued
in
his
grave
in
peace
pitton
de
tournefort
in
his
voyage
into
the
levant
gives
the
following
interesting
account
we
were
present
at
a
very
different
scene
and
one
very
barbarous
at
myconi
the
man
whose
story
we
are
going
to
relate
was
a
peasant
of
myconi
naturally
illnatured
and
quarrelsome
this
is
a
circumstance
to
be
taken
notice
of
in
such
a
case
he
was
murdered
in
the
fields
nobody
knew
how
or
by
whom
two
days
after
his
being
buried
in
a
chapel
in
the
town
it
was
noised
about
that
he
was
seen
to
walk
about
in
the
night
with
great
haste
that
he
tumbled
about
other
peoples
goods
put
out
their
lamps
gripped
them
behind
and
played
a
dozen
other
monkey
tricks
at
first
the
story
was
received
with
laughter
but
the
thing
was
looked
upon
seriously
when
the
better
sort
of
people
began
to
complain
of
it
the
paps
themselves
gave
credit
to
the
fact
and
no
doubt
had
their
reasons
for
so
doing
masses
were
duly
said
but
for
all
this
the
peasant
drove
his
old
trade
and
heeded
nothing
they
could
do
after
divers
meetings
of
the
chief
people
of
the
city
of
priests
and
monks
it
was
gravely
concluded
that
it
was
necessary
in
consequence
of
some
musty
ceremonial
to
wait
till
the
ninth
day
after
the
interment
should
be
expired
on
the
tenth
day
they
said
one
mass
in
the
chapel
where
the
body
was
laid
in
order
to
drive
out
the
demon
which
they
imagined
was
got
into
it
after
mass
they
took
up
his
body
and
got
everything
ready
for
blowing
out
his
heart
the
corpse
stunk
so
abominably
that
they
were
obliged
to
burn
frankincense
but
the
smoke
mixing
with
the
exhalations
from
the
carcase
increased
the
stench
every
person
averred
that
the
blood
of
the
corpse
was
extremely
red
the
butcher
swore
that
the
body
was
still
warm
pitton
concludes
the
story
by
ridiculing
the
theory
that
this
was
the
body
of
a
vampire
or
vroucolaca
the
practice
of
burning
the
body
of
a
suspected
or
proved
vampire
does
not
appear
to
have
found
general
favour
in
greece
doubtless
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
greeks
possessed
a
religious
horror
of
burning
a
body
on
which
holy
oil
had
been
poured
by
the
priest
when
performing
the
last
rites
upon
the
dying
man
leake
whose
travels
in
northern
greece
were
published
in
says
in
the
fourth
volume
of
that
work
it
would
be
difficult
now
to
meet
with
an
example
of
the
most
barbarous
of
all
these
superstitions
the
vruklaka
the
name
being
illyric
seems
to
acquit
the
greeks
of
the
invention
which
was
probably
introduced
into
the
country
by
the
barbarians
of
sclavonic
race
tourneforts
description
is
admitted
to
be
correct
the
devil
is
supposed
to
enter
the
vruklaka
who
rising
from
his
grave
torments
first
his
nearest
relatives
and
then
others
causing
their
death
or
loss
of
health
the
remedy
is
to
dig
up
the
body
and
if
after
it
has
been
exorcised
by
the
priest
the
demon
still
persists
in
annoying
the

if
anyone
ventures

are
brought
forward
to

the
incredulous
one
of
the
stories
told
by
the
cretans
is
as
follows
once
upon
a
time
the
village
of
kalikrti
in
the
district
of
sfakia
was
haunted
by
a
katakhans
and
the
people
did
not
know
what
man
he
was
or
from
what
part
he
came
this
katakhans
destroyed
both
children
and
fullgrown
men
and
desolated
both
that
village
and
many
others
they
had
buried
him
at
the
church
of
st
george
at
kalikrti
and
in
those
times
he
was
regarded
as
a
man
of
note
and
they
had
built
an
arch
over
his
grave
now
a
certain
shepherd
believed
to
be
his
mutual
snteknos
was
tending
his
sheep
and
goats
near
the
church
and
on
being
caught
in
a
shower
he
went
to
the
sepulchre
that
he
might
be
protected
from
the
rain
afterwards
he
determined
to
sleep
and
pass
the
night
there
and
after
taking
off
his
arms
he
placed
them
by
the
stone
which
served
him
as
his
pillow
crosswise
and
people
might
say
that
it
was
on
this
account
that
the
katakhans
was
not
permitted
to
leave
his
tomb
during
the
night
then
as
he
wished
to
go
out
again
that
he
might
destroy
men
he
said
to
the
shepherd
gossip
get
up
hence
for
i
have
some
business
that
requires
me
to
come
out
the
shepherd
answered
him
not
either
the
first
time
or
the
second
or
the
third
further
he
knew
that
the
man
had
become
a
katakhans
and
that
it
was
he
who
had
done
all
those
evil
deeds
on
this
account
he
said
to
him
on
the
fourth
time
of
his
speaking
i
shall
not
get
up
hence
gossip
for
i
fear
you
are
no
better
than
you
should
be
and
may
do
me
some
mischief
but
if
i
must
get
up
swear
to
me
by
your
windingsheet
that
you
will
not
hurt
me
and
on
that
i
will
get
up
and
he
did
not
pronounce
the
proposed
words
but
said
other
things
nevertheless
when
the
shepherd
did
not
suffer
him
to
get
up
he
swore
to
him
as
he
wished
on
this
he
got
up
and
taking
his
arms
removed
them
away
from
the
monument
and
the
katakhans
came
forth
and
after
greeting
the
shepherd
said
to
him
gossip
you
must
not
go
away
but
sit
down
here
for
i
have
some
business
which
i
must
go
after
but
i
shall
return
within
the
hour
for
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
so
the
shepherd
waited
for
him
and
the
katakhans
went
a
distance
of
about
ten
miles
where
there
was
a
couple
recently
married
and
he
destroyed
them
on
his
return
the
gossip
saw
that
he
was
carrying
some
liver
his
hands
being
moistened
with
blood
and
as
he
carried
it
he
blew
into
it
just
as
the
butcher
does
to
increase
the
size
of
the
liver
and
he
showed
his
gossip
that
it
was
cooked
as
if
it
had
been
done
on
the
fire
after
this
he
said
let
us
sit
down
gossip
that
we
may
eat
and
the
shepherd
pretended
to
eat
it
but
only
swallowed
dry
bread
and
kept
dropping
the
liver
into
his
bosom
therefore
when
the
hour
for
their
separation
arrived
the
katakhans
said
to
the
shepherd
gossip
this
which
you
have
seen
you
must
not
mention
for
if
you
do
my
twenty
nails
will
be
fixed
in
your
children
and
yourself
yet
the
shepherd
lost
no
time
but
gave
information
to
the
priests
and
others
and
they
went
to
the
tomb
and
there
they
found
the
katakhans
just
as
he
had
been
buried
and
all
people
became
satisfied
that
it
was
he
who
had
done
all
the
evil
deeds
on
this
account
they
collected
a
great
deal
of
wood
and
they
cast
him
on
it
and
burnt
him
his
gossip
was
not
present
but
when
the
katakhans
was
already
halfconsumed
he
too
came
forward
in
order
that
he
might
enjoy
the
ceremony
and
the
katakhans
cast
as
it
were
a
single
spot
of
blood
and
it
fell
on
his
foot
which
wasted
away
as
if
it
had
been
roasted
on
a
fire
on
this
account
they
sifted
even
the
ashes
and
found
the
little
finger
nail
of
the
katakhans
unburnt
and
burnt
it

britain
william
of
newbury
who
flourished
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
relates
that
in
his
time
a
man
appeared
corporeally
in
the
county
of
buckingham
for
three
nights
together
to
his
wife
and
afterwards
to
his
other
relatives
the
way
they
took
to
defend
themselves
against
his
frightful
visits
was
to
stay
up
all
night
and
make
a
noise
when
they
observed
that
he
was
coming
upon
this
he
appeared
to
several
people
in
broad
day
hereupon
the
bishop
of
lincoln
summoned
his
council
and
was
informed
that
the
thing
was
common
in
england
and
that
the
only
way
to
stop
it
which
they
knew
of
was
to
burn
the
spectre
the
bishop
did
not
relish
this
advice
as
he
thought
the
expedient
a
cruel
one
but
he
wrote
out
a
form
of
absolution
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
ordered
it
to
be
laid
on
the
body
of
the
deceased
which
was
found
to
be
as
fresh
and
entire
as
if
it
had
been
dead
only
a
day
and
from
that
time
the
apparition
was
no
more
heard
of
the
author
adds
that
these
stories
would
be
thought
incredible
if
several
instances
of
them
had
not
happened
in
his
time
attested
by
persons
of
undoubted
credit
the
same
author
mentions
a
similar
story
the
locale
of
which
was
berwickontweed
where
the
body
was
cut
in
pieces
and
burnt
another
vampire
was
burnt
at
melrose
abbey
it
was
that
of
a
very
worldly
priest
who
had
been
in
his
lifetime
so
fond
of
hunting
that
he
was
commonly
called
a
hundeprest
a
still
more
remarkable
case
occurred
at
a
castle
in
the
north
of
england
where
the
vampire
so
frightened
all
the
people
that
no
one
ever
ventured
out
of
doors
between
sunset
and
sunrise
the
sons
of
one
of
his
supposed
victims
at
length
opened
his
grave
and
pierced
his
body
from
which
a
great
quantity
of
blood
immediately
flowed
which
plainly
proved
that
a
large
number
of
persons
had
been
his
victims
at
waterford
in
ireland
there
is
a
little
graveyard
under
a
ruined
church
near

tower
legend
has
it
that
underneath
the
ground
at
this
spot
there
lies
a
beautiful
female
vampire
still
ready
to
kill
those
she
can
lure
thither
by
her
beauty
a
vampire
story
is
also
related
concerning
an
old
cumberland
farmhouse
the
victim
being
a
girl
whose
screams
were
heard
as
she
was
bitten
and
who
only
escaped
with
her
life
by
thus
screaming
in
this
case
the
monster
was
tracked
to
a
vault
in
the
churchyard
where
forty
or
fifty
coffins
were
found
open
their
contents
mutilated
and
scattered
around
one
coffin
only
was
untouched
and
on
the
lid
being
taken
off
the
form
was
recognised
as
being
that
of
the
apparition
which
had
been
seen
and
the
body
was
accordingly
burnt
when
the
manifestations
ceased
in
vol
iii
of
borderland
dr
franz
hartmann
gave
particulars
of
some
vampire
cases
which
had
come
under
his
observation
a
young
lady
of
g
had
an
admirer
who
asked
her
in
marriage
but
as
he
was
a
drunkard
she
refused
and
married
another
thereupon
the
lover
shot
himself
and
soon
after
that
event
a
vampire
assuming
his
form
visited
her
frequently
at
night
especially
when
her
husband
was
absent
she
could
not
see
him
but
felt
his
presence
in
a
way
that
could
leave
no
room
for
doubt
the
medical
faculty
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
case
they
called
it
hysterics
and
tried
in
vain
every
remedy
in
the
pharmacopia
until
she
at
last
had
the
spirit
exorcised
by
a
man
of
strong
faith
another
case
is
that
of
a
miller
at
d
who
had
a
healthy
servant
boy
who
soon
after
entering
his
service
began
to
fail
in
health
he
had
a
ravenous
appetite
but
nevertheless
grew
daily
more
feeble
being
interrogated
he
at
last
confessed
that
a
thing
which
he
could
not
see
but
which
he
could
plainly
feel
came
to
him
every
night
and
sat
upon
his
stomach
drawing
all
the
life
out
of
him
so
that
he
became
paralysed
for
the
time
being
and
could
neither
move
nor
cry
out
thereupon
the
miller
agreed
to
share
the
bed
with
the
boy
and
proposed
to
him
that
he
should
give
him
a
certain
sign
when
the
vampire
arrived
this
was
done
and
when
the
sign
was
given
the
miller
grasped
the
invisible
but
very
tangible
substance
that
rested
upon
the
boys
stomach
and
although
it
struggled
to
escape
he
grasped
it
firmly
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
after
that
the
boy
recovered
his
health
and
there
was
no
repetition
of
the
vampires
visits
dr
hartmann
adds
to
this
last
account
those
who
like
myself
have
on
innumerable
occasions
removed
astral
tumours
and
thereby
cured
physical
tumours
will
find
the
above
not
incredible
nor
inexplicable
moreover
the
above
accounts
do
not
refer
to
events
of
the
past
but
to
persons
still
living
in
this
country
the
following
account
is
taken
from
the
gentlemans
magazine
of

singular

of
superstition
ad
the

or
rather
history
of
a
case
that
happened
in

county
of

in
the
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
king

which
was
taken
from

who
writes
thus
i
write
the
evidence
which
was
given
which
i
and
many
others
heard
and
i
write
it
exactly
according
to
what
was
deposed
at

trial
at
the
bar
in
the
kings
bench
johan
norkot
the
wife
of
arthur
norkot
being
murdered
the
question
arose
how
she
came
by
her
death
the
coroners
inquest
on
view
of
the
body
and
deposition
of
mary
norkot
john
okeman
and
agnes
his
wife
inclined
to
find
joan
norkot
felo
de
se
for
they
ie
the
witnesses
before
mentioned
informed
the
coroner
and
the
jury
that
she
was
found
dead
in
the
bed
and
her
throat
cut
the
knife
sticking
in
the
floor
of
the
room
that
the
night
before
she
was
so
found
she
went
to
bed
with
her
child
now
plaintiff
in
this
appeal
her
husband
being
absent
and
that
no
other
person
after
such
time
as
she
was
gone
to
bed
came
into
the
house
the
examinants
lying
in
the
outer
room
and
they
must
needs
have
seen
if
any
stranger
had
come
in
whereupon
the
jury
gave
up
to
the
coroner
their
verdict
that
she
was
felo
de
se
but
afterwards
upon
rumour
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
observation
of
divers
circumstances
that
manifested
she
did
not
nor
according
to
these
circumstances
possibly
could
murder
herself
thereupon
the
jury
whose
verdict
was
not
drawn
into
form
by
the
coroner
desired
the
coroner
that
the
body
which
was
buried
might
be
taken
up
out
of
the
grave
which
the
coroner
assented
to
and
thirty
days
after
her
death
she
was
taken
up
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
a
great
number
of
the
people
whereupon
the
jury
changed
their
verdict
the
persons
being
tried
at
hertford
assizes
were
acquitted
but
so
much
against
the
evidence
that
the
judge
harvy
let
fall
his
opinion
that
it
were
better
an
appeal
were
brought
than

they
were
tried
on
the
appeal
which
was
brought
by
the
young
child
against
his
father
the
grandfather
and
aunt
and
her
husband
okeman
and
because
the
evidence
was
so
strange
i
took
exact
and
particular
notes
of
it
which
was
as
followeth
of
the
matters
above
mentioned
and
related
an
ancient
and
grave
person
the
minister
of
the
parish
where
the
fact
was
committed
being
sworn
to
give
evidence
according
to
custom
deposed
that
the
body
being
taken
out
of
the
grave
thirty
days
after
the
partys
death
and
lying
on
the
grave
and
the
four
defendants
present
they
were
required
each
of
them
to
touch
the
dead
body
os
wife
fell
on
her
knees
and
prayed
god
to
show
token
of
their
innocency
or
to
some
such
purpose
but
her
very
words
i
forget
the
appellers
did
touch
the
dead
body
whereupon
the
brow
of
the
dead
which
was
all
a
livid
or
carrion
colour
that
was
the
verbal
expression
in
the
terms
of
the
witness
began
to
have
a
dew
or
gentle
sweat
which
reached
down
in
drops
on
the
face
and
the
brow
turned
and
changed
to
a
lively
and
fresh
colour
and
the
dead
opened
one
of
her
eyes
and
shut
it
again
and
this
opening
the
eye
was
done
three
several
times
she
likewise
thrust
out
the
ring
or
marriage
finger
three
times
and
pulled
it
in
again
and
the
finger
dropt
blood
from
it
on
the
grass
hyde
nicholas
chief
justice
seeming
to
doubt
the
evidence
asked
the
witness
who
saw
this
beside
yourself
witness
i
cannot
swear
that
others
saw
it
but
my
lord
said
he
i
believe
the
whole
company
saw
it
and
if
it
had
been
thought
a
doubt
proof
would
have
been
made
of
it
and
many
would
have
attested
with
me
then
the
witness
observing
some
admiration
in
the
auditors
he
spoke
further
my
lord
i
am
minister
of
the
parish
long
knew
all
the
parties
but
never
had
any
occasion
of
displeasure
against
any
of
them
nor
had
to
do
with
them
or
they
with
me
but
as
their
minister
the
thing
was
wonderful
to
me
but
i
have
no
interest
in
the
matter
but
am
called
upon
to
testify
the
truth
and
that
i
have
done
this
witness
was
a
reverend
person
as
i
guess
about
seventy
years
of
age
his
testimony
was
delivered
gravely
and
temperately
but
to
the
good
admiration
of
the
auditor
whereupon
applying
himself
to
the
lord
chief
justice
he
said
my
lord
my
brother
here
present
is
minister
of
the
next
parish
adjacent
and
i
am
assured
saw
all
done
as
i
have
affirmed
whereupon
that
person
was
also
sworn
to
give
evidence
and
he
deposed
the
same
in
every
point
viz
the
sweat
of
the
brow
the
changes
of
its
colour
the
opening
of
the
eye
the
thrice
motion
of
the
finger
and
drawing
it
in
again
only
the
first
witness
deposed
that
a
man
dipped
his
finger
in
the
blood
to
examine
it
and
swore
he
believed
it
was
real
blood
i
conferred
afterwards
with
sir
edmund
vowel
barrister
at
law
and
others
who
concurred
in
this
observation
and
for
myself
if
i
were
upon
my
oath
can
depose
that
these
depositions
especially
of
the
first
witness
are
truly
here
reported
in
substance
the
other
evidence
was
given
against
the
prisoners
viz
against
the
grandmother
of
the
plaintiff
and
against
okeman
and
his
wife
that
they
lay
in
the
next
room
to
the
dead
person
that
night
and
that
none
came
into
the
house
till
they
found
her
dead
next
morning
therefore
if
she
did
not
murther
herself
they
must
be
the
murtherers
and
to
that
end
further
proof
was
made
first
she
lay
in
a
composed
manner
in
her
bed
the
bed
cloaths
nothing
at
all
disturbed
and
her
child
by
her
in
the
bed
secondly
her
throat
was
cut
from
ear
to
ear
and
her
neck
broken
and
if
she
first
cut
her
throat
she
could
not
break
her
neck
in
the
bed
nor
e
contra
thirdly
there
was
no
blood
in
the
bed
saving
that
there
was
a
tincture
of
blood
upon
the
bolster
whereupon
her
head
lay
but
no
other
substance
of
blood
at
all
fourthly
from
the
beds
head
on
there
was
a
stream
of
blood
on
the
floor
till
it
ponded
on
the
bending
of
the
floor
to
a
very
great
quantity
and
there
was
also
another
stream
of
blood
on
the
floor
at
the
beds
feet
which
ponded
also
on
the
floor
to
another
great
quantity
but
no
other
communication
of
blood
on
either
of
these
places
the
one
from
the
other
neither
upon
the
bed
so
that
she
bled
in
two
places
severely
and
it
was
deposed
that
turning
up
the
matte
of
the
bed
there
were
clotes
of
congealed
blood
in
the
straw
of
the
matte
underneath
fifthly
the
bloody
knife
in
the
morning
was
found
clinging
in
the
floor
a
good
distance
from
the
bed
but
the
point
of
the
knife
as
it
stuck
in
the
floor
was
towards
the
bed
and
the
haft
towards
the
door
sixthly
lastly
there
was
the
brand
of
a
thumb
and
four
fingers
of
a
left
hand
on
the
dead
persons
left
hand
hyde
chief
justice
how
can
you
know
the
print
of
a
left
hand
from
the
print
of
a
right
hand
in
such
a
case
witness
my
lord
it
is
hard
to
describe
it
but
if
it
please
the
honourable
judge
ie
the
judge
sitting
on
the
bench
beside
the
chief
justice
to
put
his
left
hand
on
your
left
hand
you
cannot
possibly
place
your
right
hand
in
the
same
posture
it
being
done
and
appearing
so
the
defendants
had
time
to
make
their
defence
but
gave
no
evidence
to
that
purpose
the
jury
departing
from
the
bar
and
returning
acquitted
okeman
and
found
the
other
three
guilty
who
being
severally
demanded
why
judgment
should
not
be
pronounced
sayd
nothing
but
each
of
them
said
i
did
not
do
it
i
did
not
do
it
judgment
was
made
and
the
grandmother
and
the
husband
executed
but
the
aunt
had
the
privilege
to
be
spared
execution
being
with
child
i
enquired
if
they
confessed
anything
at
execution
but
did
not
as
i
was
told
thus
far
the
serjeant
afterwards
sir
john
mainard

person
of
great
note
and
judgment
in
the
law
the
paper
of
which
this
is
a
copy
was
found
amongst
his
papers
since
his
death
fair
written
with
his
own
hand
mr
hunt
of
the
temple
took
a
copy
of
it
gave
it
me
which
i
have
hereby
transcribedh
s
it
has
been
asserted
by
some
writers
that
the
vampire
is
not
to
be
found
in
indian
lore
and
legend
and
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
connect
this
supposititious
absence
of
the
bloodsucking
demon
with
the
brahminical
and
buddhistic
vegetarian
and
cremation
customs
the
indian
belief
however
in
the
existence
of
vampire
spectres
is
as
prevalent
as
it
is
in
any
other
country
although
the
folklore
and
legends
concerning
them
may
perhaps
be
more
scarce
fornari
in
his
history
of
sorcerers
relates
the
following
story
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
there
lived
at
bagdad
an
aged
merchant
who
had
grown
wealthy
in
his
business
and
who
had
an
only
son
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
he
resolved
to
marry
him
to
the
daughter
of
another
merchant
a
girl
of
considerable
fortune
but
without
any
personal
attractions
abulhassan
the
merchants
son
on
being
shown
the
portrait
of
the
lady
requested
his
father
to
delay
the
marriage
till
he
could
reconcile
his
mind
to
it
instead
however
of
doing
this
he
fell
in
love
with
another
girl
the
daughter
of
a
sage
and
he
gave
his
father
no
peace
till
he
consented
to
the
marriage
with
the
object
of
his
affections
the
old
man
stood
out
as
long
as
he
could
but
finding
that
his
son
was
bent
on
acquiring
the
hand
of
the
fair
nadilla
and
was
equally
resolute
not
to
accept
the
rich
and
ugly
lady
he
did
what
most
fathers
under
such
circumstances
would
dohe
acquiesced
the
wedding
took
place
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
and
a
happy
honeymoon
ensued
which
might
have
been
happier
but
for
one
little
circumstance
which
led
to
very
serious
consequences
abulhassan
noticed
that
his
bride
quitted
the
nuptial
couch
as
soon
as
she
thought
her
husband
was
asleep
and
did
not
return
to
it
till
an
hour
before
dawn
filled
with
curiosity
hassan
one
night
feigning
sleep
saw
his
wife
rise
and
leave
the
room
he
rose
followed
cautiously
and
saw
her
enter
the
cemetery
by
the
straggling
moonbeams
he
saw
her
go
into
a
tomb
he
stepped
in
after
her
the
scene
within
was
horrible
a
party
of
ghouls
were
assembled
with
the
spoils
of
the
graves
they
had
violated
and
were
feasting
on
the
flesh
of
the
longburied
corpses
his
own
wife
who
by
the
way
never
touched
supper
at
home
played
a
no
inconsiderable
part
in
the
hideous
banquet
as
soon
as
he
could
safely
escape
abulhassan
stole
back
to
his
bed
he
said
nothing
to
his
bride
till
next
evening
when
supper
was
laid
and
she
declined
to
eat
then
he
insisted
on
her
partaking
and
when
she
positively
refused
he
exclaimed
roughly
oh
yes
you
keep
your
appetite
for
your
feasts
with
the
ghouls
nadilla
was
silent
she
turned
pale
and
trembled
and
without
a
word
sought
her
bed
at
midnight
she
rose
fell
on
her
husband
with
her
nails
and
teeth
tore
his
throat
and
having
opened
a
vein
attempted
to
suck
his
blood
but
abulhassan
springing
to
his
feet
threw
her
down
and
with
a
blow
killed
her
she
was
buried
next
day
three
days
after
at
midnight
she
reappeared
attacked
her
husband
again
and
again
attempted
to
suck
his
blood
he
fled
from
her
and
on
the
morrow
opened
her
tomb
burnt
her
to
ashes
and
cast
the
ashes
into
the
tigris
there
is
a
monstrous
vampire
which
is
said
to
delight
in
sucking
the
blood
of
children
and
is
known
as
a
pnangglan
it
has
also
a
liking
for
sucking
the
blood
of
women

childbirth

as
it
is
also
credited
with
a
dread
of
thorns

germany
the
home
of
modern
philosophy
is
not
free
from
the
belief
in
the
reality
of
the
vampire
apparition
although
the
more
horrible
forms
of
the
superstition
are
not
frequently

crosses
are
however
frequently
erected
at
the
head
or
by
the
side
of
graves
even
in
protestant
cemeteries
in
order
that
their
presence
may
prevent
the
occupants
from
being
controlled
by
any
demon

might

sure

the
following
story
was
contributed
by
dr
franz
hartmann
to
the
occult
review
for
september
under
the
title
of
an
authenticated
vampire
story
on
june
th
there
appeared
in
a
prominent
vienna
paper
the
neues
wiener
journal
a
notice
saying
that
the
castle
of
b
had
been
burned
by
the
populace
because
there
was
a
great
mortality
among
the
peasant
children
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
this
was
due
to
the
invasion
of
a
vampire
supposed
to
be
the
last
count
b
who
died
and
acquired
that
reputation
the
castle
was
situated
in
a
wild
and
desolate
part
of
the
carpathian
mountains
and
was
formerly
a
fortification
against
the
turks
it
was
not
inhabited
owing
to
its
being
believed
to
be
in
the
possession
of
ghosts
only
a
wing
of
it
was
used
as
a
dwelling
for
the
caretaker
and
his
wife
now
it
so
happened
that
when
i
read
the
above
notice
i
was
sitting
in
a
coffeehouse
at
vienna
in
company
with
an
old
friend
of
mine
who
is
an
experienced
occultist
and
editor
of
a
wellknown
journal
and
who
had
spent
several
months
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
from
him
i
obtained
the
following
account
and
it
appears
that
the
vampire
in
question
was
probably
not
the
old
count
but
his
beautiful
daughter
the
countess
elga
whose
photograph
taken
from
the
original
painting
i
obtained
my
friend
said
two
years
ago
i
was
living
at
hermannstadt
and
being
engaged
in
engineering
a
road
through
the
hills
i
often
came
within
the
vicinity
of
the
old
castle
where
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
old
castellan
or
caretaker
and
his
wife
who
occupied
a
part
of
the
wing
of
the
house
almost
separate
from
the
main
body
of
the
building
they
were
a
quiet
old
couple
and
rather
reticent
in
giving
information
or
expressing
an
opinion
in
regard
to
the
strange
noises
which
were
often
heard
at
night
in
the
deserted
halls
or
of
the
apparitions
which
the
wallachian
peasants
claimed
to
have
seen
when
they
loitered
in
the
surroundings
after
dark
all
i
could
gather
was
that
the
old
count
was
a
widower
and
had
a
beautiful
daughter
who
was
one
day
killed
by
a
fall
from
her
horse
and
that
soon
after
the
old
man
died
in
some
mysterious
manner
and
the
bodies
were
buried
in
a
solitary
graveyard
belonging
to
a
neighbouring
village
not
long
after
their
death
an
unusual
mortality
was
noticed
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
several
children
and
even
some
grown
people
died
without
any
apparent
illness
they
merely
wasted
away
and
thus
a
rumour
was
started
that
the
old
count
had
become
a
vampire
after
his
death
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
not
a
saint
as
he
was
addicted
to
drinking
and
some
shocking
tales
were
in
circulation
about
his
conduct
and
that
of
his
daughter
but
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
them
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
say
afterwards
the
property
came
into
the
possession
of
a
distant
relative
of
the
family
who
is
a
young
man
and
officer
in
a
cavalry
regiment
at
vienna
it
appears
that
the
heir
enjoyed
his
life
at
the
capital
and
did
not
trouble
himself
much
about
the
old
castle
in
the
wilderness
he
did
not
even
come
to
look
at
it
but
gave
his
directions
by
letter
to
the
janitor
telling
him
merely
to
keep
things
in
order
and
to
attend
to
repairs
if
any
were
necessary
thus
the
castellan
was
actually
master
of
the
house
and
offered
its
hospitality
to
me
and
my
friends
one
evening
i
and
my
two
assistants
dr
e
a
young
lawyer
and
mr
w
a
literary
man
went
to
inspect
the
premises
first
we
went
to
the
stables
there
were
no
horses
as
they
had
been
sold
but
what
attracted
our
special
attention
was
an
old
queerfashioned
coach
with
gilded
ornaments
and
bearing
the
emblems
of
the
family
we
then
inspected
the
rooms
passing
through
some
halls
and
gloomy
corridors
such
as
may
be
found
in
any
old
castle
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
furniture
but
in
one
of
the
halls
there
hung
in
a
frame
an
oilpainting
a
portrait
representing
a
lady
with
a
large
hat
and
wearing
a
fur
coat
we
were
all
involuntarily
startled
on
beholding
this
picturenot
so
much
on
account
of
the
beauty
of
the
lady
but
on
account
of
the
uncanny
expression
of
her
eyes
and
dr
e
after
looking
at
the
picture
for
a
short
time
suddenly
exclaimed
how
strange
the
picture
closes
its
eyes
and
opens
them
again
and
now
it
begins
to
smile
now
dr
e
is
a
very
sensitive
person
and
has
more
than
once
had
some
experience
in
spiritism
and
we
made
up
our
minds
to
form
a
circle
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
this
phenomenon
accordingly
on
the
same
evening
we
sat
around
a
table
in
an
adjoining
room
forming
a
magnetic
chain
with
our
hands
soon
the
table
began
to
move
and
the
name
elga
was
spelled
we
asked
who
this
elga
was
and
the
answer
was
rapped
out
the
lady
whose
picture
you
have
seen
is
the
lady
living
asked
mr
w
this
question
was
not
answered
but
instead
it
was
rapped
out
if
w
desires
it
i
will
appear
to
him
bodily
tonight
at
two
oclock
w
consented
and
now
the
table
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
life
and
manifested
a
great
affection
for
w
it
rose
on
two
legs
and
pressed
against
his
breast
as
if
it
intended
to
embrace
him
we
inquired
of
the
castellan
whom
the
picture
represented
but
to
our
surprise
he
did
not
know
he
said
that
it
was
the
copy
of
a
picture
painted
by
the
celebrated
painter
hans
markart
of
vienna
and
had
been
bought
by
the
old
count
because
its
demoniacal
look
pleased
him
so
much
we
left
the
castle
and
w
retired
to
his
room
at
an
inn
a
halfhours
journey
distant
from
that
place
he
was
of
a
somewhat
sceptical
turn
of
mind
being
neither
a
firm
believer
in
ghosts
and
apparitions
nor
ready
to
deny
their
possibility
he
was
not
afraid
but
anxious
to
see
what
would
come
of
his
agreement
and
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
himself
awake
he
sat
down
and
began
to
write
an
article
for
a
journal
towards
two
oclock
he
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
and
the
door
of
the
hall
opened
there
was
the
rustling
of
a
silk
dress
and
the
sound
of
the
feet
of
a
lady
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
corridor
it
may
be
imagined
that
he
was
somewhat
startled
but
taking
courage
he
said
to
himself
if
this
is
elga
let
her
come
in
then
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
elga
entered
she
was
most
elegantly
dressed
and
appeared
still
more
youthful
and
seductive
than
the
picture
there
was
a
lounge
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
where
w
was
writing
and
there
she
silently
posted
herself
she
did
not
speak
but
her
looks
and
gestures
left
no
doubt
in
regard
to
her
desires
and
intentions
mr
w
resisted
the
temptation
and
remained
firm
it
is
not
known
whether
he
did
so
out
of
principle
or
timidity
or
fear
be
this
as
it
may
he
kept
on
writing
looking
from
time
to
time
at
his
visitor
and
silently
wishing
that
she
would
leave
at
last
after
half
an
hour
which
seemed
to
him
much
longer
the
lady
departed
in
the
same
manner
in
which
she
came
this
adventure
left
w
no
peace
and
we
consequently
arranged
several
sittings
at
the
old
castle
where
a
variety
of
uncanny
phenomena
took
place
thus
for
instance
once
the
servantgirl
was
about
to
light
a
fire
in
the
stove
when
the
door
of
the
apartment
opened
and
elga
stood
there
the
girl
frightened
out
of
her
wits
rushed
from
the
room
tumbling
down
the
stairs
in
terror
with
the
lamp
in
her
hand
which
broke
and
came
very
near
to
setting
her
clothes
on
fire
lighted
lamps
and
candles
went
out
when
brought
near
the
picture
and
many
other
manifestations
took
place
which
it
would
be
tedious
to
describe
but
the
following
incident
ought
not
to
be
omitted
mr
w
was
at
that
time
desirous
of
obtaining
the
position
as
coeditor
of
a
certain
journal
and
a
few
days
after
the
abovenarrated
adventure
he
received
a
letter
in
which
a
noble
lady
of
high
position
offered
him
her
patronage
for
that
purpose
the
writer
requested
him
to
come
to
a
certain
place
the
same
evening
where
he
would
meet
a
gentleman
who
would
give
him
further
particulars
he
went
and
was
met
by
an
unknown
stranger
who
told
him
that
he
was
requested
by
the
countess
elga
to
invite
mr
w
to
a
carriage
drive
and
that
she
would
await
him
at
midnight
at
a
certain
crossing
of
two
roads
not
far
from
the
village
the
stranger
then
suddenly
disappeared
now
it
seems
that
mr
w
had
some
misgivings
about
the
meeting
and
drive
and
he
hired
a
policeman
as
detective
to
go
at
midnight
to
the
appointed
place
to
see
what
would
happen
the
policeman
went
and
reported
next
morning
that
he
had
seen
nothing
but
the
wellknown
oldfashioned
carriage
from
the
castle
with
two
black
horses
standing
there
as
if
waiting
for
somebody
and
that
as
he
had
no
occasion
to
interfere
he
merely
waited
until
the
carriage
moved
on
when
the
castellan
of
the
castle
was
asked
he
swore
that
the
carriage
had
not
been
out
that
night
and
in
fact
it
could
not
have
been
out
as
there
were
no
horses
to
draw
it
but
that
is
not
all
for
on
the
following
day
i
met
a
friend
who
is
a
great
sceptic
and
disbeliever
in
ghosts
and
always
used
to
laugh
at
such
things
now
however
he
seemed
to
be
very
serious
and
said
last
night
something
very
strange
happened
to
me
at
about
one
oclock
this
morning
i
returned
from
a
late
visit
and
as
i
happened
to
pass
the
graveyard
of
the
village
i
saw
a
carriage
with
gilded
ornaments
standing
at
the
entrance
i
wondered
about
this
taking
place
at
such
an
unusual
hour
and
being
curious
to
see
what
would
happen
i
waited
two
elegantly
dressed
ladies
issued
from
the
carriage
one
of
these
was
young
and
pretty
but
threw
at
me
a
devilish
and
scornful
look
as
they
both
passed
by
and
entered
the
cemetery
there
they
were
met
by
a
welldressed
man
who
saluted
the
ladies
and
spoke
to
the
younger
one
saying
why
miss
elga
are
you
returned
so
soon
such
a
queer
feeling
came
over
me
that
i
abruptly
left
and
hurried
home
this
matter
has
not
been
explained
but
certain
experiments
which
we
subsequently
made
with
the
picture
of
elga
brought
out
some
curious
facts
to
look
at
the
picture
for
a
certain
time
caused
me
to
feel
a
very
disagreeable
sensation
in
the
region
of
the
solar
plexus
i
began
to
dislike
the
portrait
and
proposed
to
destroy
it
we
held
a
sitting
in
the
adjoining
room
the
table
manifested
a
great
aversion
to
my
presence
it
was
rapped
out
that
i
should
leave
the
circle
and
that
the
picture
must
not
be
destroyed
i
ordered
a
bible
to
be
brought
in
and
read
the
beginning
of
the
first
chapter
of
st
john
whereupon
the
abovementioned
mr
e
the
medium
and
another
man
present
claimed
that
they
saw
the
picture
distorting
its
face
i
turned
the
frame
and
pricked
the
back
of
the
picture
with
my
penknife
in
different
places
and
mr
e
as
well
as
the
other
man
felt
all
the
pricks
although
they
had
retired
to
the
corridor
i
made
the
sign
of
the
pentagram
over
the
picture
and
again
the
two
gentlemen
claimed
that
the
picture
was
horribly
distorting
its
face
soon
afterwards
we
were
called
away
and
left
that
country
of
elga
i
heard
nothing
more
thus

goes
the
account
of
my
friend
the
editor
siegberts
chronicle
for
the
year
has
the
following
story
there
appeared
this
year
in
the
diocese
of
mentz
a
spirit
which
discovered
himself
at
first
by
throwing
stones
and
beating
against
the
walls
of
houses
as
if
it
had
been
with
a
great
mallet
he
then
proceeded
to
speak
and
reveal
secrets
and
discovered
the
authors
of
several
thefts
and
other
matters
likely
to
breed
disturbances
in
the
neighbourhood
at
last
he
vented
his
malice
upon
one
particular
person
whom
he
was
industrious
in
persecuting
and
making
odious
to
all
the
neighbours
by
representing
him
as
the
cause
of
gods
anger
against
the
whole
village
the
spirit
never
forsook
the
poor
man
but
tormented
him
without
intermission
burnt
all
his
corn
in
the
barns
and
set
every
place
on
fire
where
he
came
the
priests
attempted
to
frighten
him
away
by
exorcisms
prayers
and
holy
water
but
the
spectre
answered
them
with
a
volley
of
stones
which
wounded
several
of
them
when
the
priests
were
gone
he
was
heard
to
bemoan
himself
and
say
that
he
was
forced
to
take
refuge
in
the
cowl
of
one
of
the
priests
who
had
injured
the
daughter
of
a
man
of
consequence
in
the
village
he
continued
in
this
manner
to
infest
the
village
for
three
years
together
and
never
gave
over
till
he
had
set
every
house
in
it
on
fire
chapter
vi
vampirism
in
hungary
bavaria
and
silesia
the
hungarians
believe
that
those
who
have
been
passive
vampires
in
life
become
active
vampires
after
death
that
those
whose
blood
has
been
sucked
in
life
by
vampires
become
themselves
vampires
after
death
in
many
districts
the
belief
also
prevails
that
the
only
way
to
prevent
this
calamity
happening
is
for
the
threatened
victim
to
eat
some
earth
from
the
grave
of
the
attacking
vampire
and
to
smear
his
own
body
with
blood
from
the
body
of
that
vampire
that
the
belief
in
vampirism
is
still
current
in
hungary
was
evidenced
recently
the
daily
telegraph
of
february
th
contained
the
following
paragraph
a
budapesth
telegram
to
the
messaggero
reports
a
terrible
instance
of
superstition
a
boy
of
fourteen
died
some
days
ago
in
a
small
village
a
farmer
in
whose
employment
the
boy
had
been
thought
that
the
ghost
of
the
latter
appeared
to
him
every
night
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
these
supposed
visitations
the
farmer
accompanied
by
some
friends
went
to
the
cemetery
one
night
stuffed
three
pieces
of
garlic
and
three
stones
in
the
mouth
and
thrust
a
stake
through
the
corpse
fixing
it
to
the
ground
this
was
to
deliver
themselves
from
the
evil
spirit
as
the
credulous
farmer
and
his
friends
stated
when
they
were
arrested
in
in
a
village
in
hungary
in
the
space
of
three
months
seventeen
persons
of
different
ages
died
of
vampirism
some
without
being
ill
and
others
after
languishing
two
or
three
days
it
is
reported
that
a
girl
named
stanoska
daughter
of
the
heyduk
jotiutso
who
went
to
bed
in
perfect
health
awoke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
trembling
violently
and
uttering
terrible
shrieks
declaring
that
the
son
of
the
heyduk
millo
who
had
been
dead
nine
weeks
had
nearly
strangled
her
in
her
sleep
she
fell
into
a
languid
state
and
died
at
the
end
of
three
days

was
exhumed
and

calmet
in
his
work
the
phantom
world
relates
the
following
about
fifteen
years
ago
a
soldier
who
was
billeted
at
the
house
of
a
haidamaque
peasant
on
the
frontiers
of
hungary
as
he
was
one
day
sitting
at
table
near
his
host
the
master
of
the
house
saw
a
person
he
did
not
know
come
in
and
sit
down
to
table
also
with
them
the
master
of
the
house
was
strangely
frightened
at
this
as
were
the
rest
of
the
company
the
soldier
knew
not
what
to
think
of
it
being
ignorant
of
the
matter
in
question
but
the
master
of
the
house
being
dead
the
very
next
day
the
soldier
inquired
what
it
meant
they
told
him
it
was
the
body
of
the
father
of
the
host
who
had
been
dead
and
buried
for
ten
years
who
had
thus
come
to
sit
down
next
to
him
and
had
announced
and
caused
his
death
the
soldier
informed
the
regiment
of
it
in
the
first
place
and
the
regiment
gave
notice
of
it
to
the
general
officers
who
commissioned
the
count
de
cabreras
captain
of
the
regiment
of
alandetti
infantry
to
make
information
concerning
this
circumstance
having
gone
to
the
place
with
some
other
officers
a
surgeon
and
an
auditor
they
heard
the
depositions
of
all
the
people
belonging
to
the
house
who
decided
unanimously
that
the
ghost
was
the
father
of
the
master
of
the
house
and
that
all
the
soldier
had
said
and
reported
was
the
exact
truth
which
was
confirmed
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
in
consequence
of
this
the
corpse
of
the
spectre
was
exhumed
and
found
to
be
like
that
of
a
man
who
had
just
expired
and
his
blood
like
that
of
a
living
man
the
count
de
cabreras
had
his
head
cut
off
and
caused
him
to
be
laid
again
in
the
tomb
he
also
took
information
concerning
other
similar
ghosts
among
others
of
a
man
dead
more
than
thirty
years
who
had
come
back
three
times
to
his
house
at
mealtime
the
first
time
he
had
sucked
the
blood
from
the
neck
of
his
own
brother
the
second
time
from
one
of
his
sons
and
the
third
time
from
one
of
the
servants
in
the
house
and
all
three
died
of
it
instantly
and
on
the
spot
upon
this
deposition
the
commissary
had
this
man
taken
out
of
his
grave
and
finding
that
like
the
first
his
blood
was
in
a
fluidic
state
like
that
of
a
living
person
he
ordered
them
to
run
a
large
nail
into
his
temple
and
then
to
lay
him
again
in
the
grave
he
caused
a
third
to
be
burned
who
had
been
buried
more
than
sixteen
years
and
had
sucked
the
blood
and
caused
the
death
of
two
of
his
sons
the
commissary
having
made
his
report
to
the
general
officers
was
deputed
to
the
emperor
who
commanded
that
some
officers
both
of
war
and
of
justice
some
physicians
and
surgeons
and
some
learned
men
should
be
sent
to
examine
the
causes
of
these
extraordinary
events
the
person
who
related
these
particulars
to
us
had
heard
them
from
the
count
de
cabreras
at
fribourg
in
raufft
tells
the
story
of
a
man
named
peter
plogojowitz
an
inhabitant
of
a
village
in
hungary
called
kisolova
who
after
he
had
been
buried
more
than
ten
years
appeared
by
night
to
several
persons
in
the
village
while
they
were
asleep
and
squeezed
their
throats
in
such
a
manner
that
they
expired
within
twentyfour
hours
there
died
in
this
way
no
less
than
nine
persons
in
eight
days
and
the
widow
of
this
plogojowitz
deposed
that
she
herself
had
been
visited
by
him
since
his
death
and
that
his
errand
was
to
demand
his
shoes
which
frightened
her
so
much
that
she
at
once
left
kisolova
and
went
to
live
somewhere
else
these
circumstances
determined
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
to
dig
up
the
body
of
plogojowitz
and
burn
it
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
such
troublesome
visits
accordingly
they
applied
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
emperors
troops
in
the
district
of
gradisca
in
the
kingdom
of
hungary
and
to
the
incumbent
of
the
place
for
leave
to
dig
up
the
corpse
they
both
made
a
great
many
scruples
about
granting
it
but
the
peasants
declared
plainly
that
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
dig
up
this
accursed
carcase
which
they
were
fully
convinced
was
a
vampire
they
would
be
forced
to
leave
the
village
and
settle
where
they
could
the
officer
who
gave
this
account
seeing
that
there
was
no
hindering
them
either
by
fair
means
or
foul
came
in
person
accompanied
by
the
minister
of
gradisca
to
kisolova
and
they
were
both
present
at
the
digging
up
of
the
corpse
which
they
found
to
be
free
from
any
bad
smell
and
perfectly
sound
as
if
it
had
been
alive
except
that
the
tip
of
the
nose
was
a
little
dry
and
withered
the
beard
and
hair
were
grown
fresh
and
a
new
set
of
nails
had
sprung
up
in
the
room
of
the
old
ones
that
had
fallen
off
under
the
former
skin
which
looked
pale
and
dead
there
appeared
a
new
one
of
a
natural
fresh
colour
and
the
hands
and
feet
were
as
entire
as
if
they
belonged
to
a
person
in
perfect
health
they
observed
also
that
the
mouth
of
the
vampire
was
full
of
fresh
blood
which
the
people
were
persuaded
had
been
sucked
by
him
from
the
persons
he
had
killed
the
officer
and
the
divine
having
diligently
examined
into
all
the
circumstances
the
people
being
fired
with
fresh
indignation
and
growing
more
fully
persuaded
that
this
carcase
was
the
real
cause
of
the
death
of
their
countrymen
ran
immediately
to
fetch
a
sharp
stake
which
being
driven
into
his
breast
there
issued
from
the
wound
and
also
from
his
nose
and
mouth
a
great
quantity
of
fresh
ruddy
blood
and
something
which
indicated
a
sort
of
life
was
observed
to
come
from
him
the
peasants
then
laid
the
body
upon
a
pile
of
wood
and
burnt
it
to
ashes
calmet
says
he
was
told
by
m
de
vassimont
who
was
sent
to
moravia
by
leopold
first
duke
of
lorraine
that
he
was
informed
by
public
report
that
it
was
common
enough
in
that
country
to
see
men
who
had
died
some
time
before
present
themselves
in
a
party
and
sit
down
to
the
table
with
persons
of
their
acquaintance
without
saying
anything
but
that
nodding
to
one
of
the
party
he
would
infallibly
die
some
days
afterwards
m
de
vassimont
received
confirmation
of
this
story
from
several
persons
amongst
others
an
old
cur
who
said
he
had
seen
more
than
one
instance
of
it
the
priest
added
that
the
inhabitants
had
been
delivered
from
these
troublesome
spectres
owing
to
the
fact
that
their
corpses
had
been
taken
up
and
burned
or
destroyed
in
some
way
or
other
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
several
vampire
investigations
were
held
at
the
instigation
of
the
bishop
of
olmutz
the
village
of
liebava
was
particularly
infested
and
a
hungarian
placed
himself
on
the
top
of
the
church
tower
and
just
before
midnight
saw
a
wellknown
vampire
issue
from
his
tomb
and
leaving
his
windingsheet
behind
him
proceed
on
his
rounds
the
hungarian
descended
from
the
tower
and
took
away
the
sheet
and
ascended
the
tower
again
when
the
vampire
returned
he
flew
into
a
great
fury
because
of
the
absence
of
the
sheet
the
hungarian
called
to
him
to
come
up
to
the
tower
and
fetch
it
the
vampire
mounted
the
ladder
but
just
before
he
reached
the
top
the
hungarian
gave
him
a
blow
on
the
head
which
threw
him
down
to
the
churchyard
his
assailant
then
descended
cut
off
the
vampires
head
with
a
hatchet
and
from
that
time
the
vampire
was
no
more
heard
of
in
there
dwelt
in
the
market
town
of
kring
in
the
archduchy
of
krain
a
man
named
george
grando
who
died
and
was
buried
by
father
george
a
monk
of
st
paul
who
on
returning
to
the
widows
house
saw
grando
sitting
behind
the
door
the
monk
and
the
neighbours
fled
soon
stories
began
to
circulate
of
a
dark
figure
being
seen
to
go
about
the
streets
by
night
stopping
now
and
then
to
tap
at
the
door
of
a
house
but
never
to
wait
for
an
answer
in
a
little
while
people
began
to
die
mysteriously
in
kring
and
it
was
noticed
that
the
deaths
occurred
in
the
houses
at
which
the
spectred
figure
had
tapped
its
signal
the
widow
grando
also
complained
that
she
was
tormented
by
the
spirit
of
her
husband
who
night
after
night
threw
her
into
a
deep
sleep
with
the
object
of
sucking
her
blood
the
supan
or
chief
magistrate
of
kring
decided
to
take
the
usual
steps
to
ascertain
whether
grando
was
a
vampire
he
called
together
some
of
the
neighbours
fortified
them
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
spirituous
liquor
and
they
sallied
off
with
torches
and
a
crucifix
grandos
grave
was
opened
and
the
body
was
found
to
be
perfectly
sound
and
not
decomposed
the
mouth
being
opened
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
there
was
a
rosy
flush
on
the
cheeks
the
whole
party
were
seized
with
terror
and
hurried
back
to
kring
with
the
exception
of
the
supan
the
second
visit
was
made
in
company
with
a
priest
and
the
party
also
took
a
heavy
stick
of
hawthorn
sharpened
to
a
point
the
grave
and
body
were
found
to
be
exactly
as
they
had
been

kneeled
down
solemnly
and
held

upon
the

he
went
on
to
address
the
corpse
when
it
was
seen
that
great
tears
were
rolling
down
the
vampires
cheeks
a
hawthorn
stake
was
brought
forward
and
as
often
as
they
strove
to
drive
it
through
the
body
the
sharpened
wood
rebounded
and
it
was
not
until
one
of
the
number
sprang
into
the
grave
and
cut
off
the
vampires
head
that
the
evil
spirit
departed
with
a
loud
shriek
and
a
contortion
of
the
limbs
similar
stories
to
this
were
continually
being
circulated
from
the
borders
of
hungary
to
the
baltic
at
one
time
the
spectre
of
a
village
herdsman
near
kodom
in
bavaria
began
to
appear
to
several
inhabitants
of
the
place
and
either
in
consequence
of
their
fright
or
from
some
other
cause
every
person
who
had
seen
the
apparition
died
during
the
week
afterwards
driven
to
despair
the
peasants
disinterred
the
corpse
and
pinned
it
to
the
ground
with
a
long
stake
the
same
night
he
appeared
again
plunging
people
into
convulsions
of
fright
and
suffocated
several
of
them
then
the
village
authorities
handed
the
body
over
to
the
executioner
who
caused
it
to
be
carried
into
a
field
adjoining
the
cemetery
where
it
was
burned
the
corpse
howled
like
a
madman
kicking
and
tearing
as
if
it
had
been
alive
when
it
was
run
through
again
with
sharppointed
stakes
before
the
burning
it
uttered
piercing
cries
and
vomited
masses
of
crimson
blood
the
apparition
of
the
spectre
ceased
only
after
the
corpse
had
been
reduced
to
ashes
fortis

his
travels
into
dalmatia
says
that
the
moslacks
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
vampires
and
attribute
to
them
as
in
transylvania
the
sucking
of
the
blood
of
infants
therefore
when
a
man
dies

he
is

of

however
spread
abroad
the

that
he
had
died
of
apoplexy
which
enabled
them
to
bury
him
in
the
ordinary
way
and
save
the
disgrace
of
his
being
interred
as
a
suicide
despite
this
however
the

got
abroad

to
the
bottom
of
the
pure
and
transparent
spring
of
her
thoughts
why
then
did
arnod
shrink
from
meeting
her
he
was
young
had
a
little
property
had
health
and
industry
and
he
had
told
his
friends
he
had
formed
no
ties
in
other
lands
why
then
did
he
avoid
the
fascination
of
the
pretty
nina
who
seemed
a
being
made
to
chase
from
any
brow
the
clouds
of
gathering
care
but
he
did
so
yet
less
and
less
resolutely
for
he
felt
the
charm
of
her
presence
who
could
have
done
otherwise
and
how
long
he
resisted
the
impulse
of
his
fondness
for
the
innocent
girl
who
sought
to
cheer
his
fits
of
depression
and
they
were
to
be
unitedwere
betrothed
yet
still
the
anxious
gloom
would
fitfully
overcast
his
countenance
even
in
the
sunshine
of
those
hours
what
is
it
dear
arnod
that
makes
you
sad
it
cannot
be
on
my
account
i
know
for
you
were
sad
before
you
noticed
me
and
that
i
think
surely
first
made
me
notice
you
nina
he
answered
i
have
done
i
fear
a
great
wrong
in
trying
to
gain
your
affections
nina
i
have
a
fixed
impression
that
i
shall
not
live
yet
knowing
this
i
have
selfishly
made
my
existence
necessary
to
your
happiness
how
strangely
you
talk
dear
arnod
who
in
the
village
is
stronger
and
healthier
than
you
you
feared
no
danger
when
you
were
a
soldier
what
danger
do
you
fear
as
a
villager
of
meduegna
it
haunts
me
nina
but
arnod
you
were
sad
before
you
thought
of
me
did
you
then
fear
to
die
oh
nina
it
is
something
worse
than
death
and
his
vigorous
frame
shook
with
agony
arnod
i
conjure
you
tell
me
it
was
in
cossova
this
fate
befell
me
here
you
have
hitherto
escaped
the
terrible
scourge
but
there
they
die
and
the
dead
visit
the
living
i
experienced
the
first
frightful
visitation
and
i
fled
but
not
till
i
had
sought
his
grave
and
executed
the
dread
expiation
from
the
vampire
ninas
blood
ran
cold
she
stood
horrorstricken
but
her
young
heart
soon
mastered
her
first
despair
with
a
touching
voice
she
spoke
fear
not
dear
arnod
fear
not
now
i
will
be
your
shield
or
i
will
die
with
you
and
she
encircled
his
neck
with
her
gentle
arms
and
returning
hope
shone
irislike
amid
her
falling
tears
afterwards
they
found
a
reasonable
ground
for
banishing
or
allaying
their
apprehension
in
the
lengthy
time
which
had
elapsed
since
arnod
left
cossova
during
which
no
fearful
visitant
had
again
approached
him
and
they
fondly
protested
that
gave
them
security
one
day
about
a
week
after
this
conversation
arnod
missed
his
footing
when
on
the
top
of
a
loaded
haywaggon
and
fell
from
it
to
the
ground
he
was
picked
up
insensible
and
carried
home
where
after
lingering
a
short
time
he
died
his
interment
as
usual
followed
immediately
his
fate
was
sad
and
premature
but
what
pencil
could
paint
ninas
grief
twenty
or
thirty
days
after
his
decease
several
in
the
neighbourhood
complained
that
they
were
haunted
by
the
deceased
arnod
and
what
was
more
to
the
purpose
four
of
them
died
the
evil
looked
at
sceptically
was
bad
enough
but
aggravated
by
the
suggestions
of
superstition
it
spread
a
panic
through
the
whole
district
to
allay
the
popular
terror
and
if
possible
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
evil
a
determination
was
come
to
publicly
to
disinter
the
body
of
arnod
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
he
really
was
a
vampire
and
in
that
event
of
treating
him
conformably
the
day
fixed
for
these
proceedings
was
the
fortieth
after
his
burial
it
was
on
a
grey
morning
in
early
august
that
the
commission
visited
the
cemetery
of
meduegna
which
surrounded
with
a
wall
of
stone
lies
sheltered
by
the
mountain
that
rising
in
undulating
green
slopes
irregularly
planted
with
fruittrees
ends
in
an
abrupt
craggy
ridge
covered
with
underwood
the
graves
were
for
the
most
part
neatly
kept
with
borders
of
box
or
something
like
it
and
flowers
between
and
at
the
head
of
most
a
small
wooden
cross
painted
black
bearing
the
name
of
the
tenant
here
and
there
a
stone
had
been
raised
one
of
terrible
height
a
single
narrow
slab
ornamented
with
grotesque
gothic
carvings
dominated
over
the
rest
near
this
lay
the
grave
of
arnod
paole
towards
which
the
party
moved
the
work
of
throwing
out
the
earth
was
begun
by
the
grey
careful
old
sexton
who
lived
in
the
leichenhaus
beyond
the
great
crucifix
near
the
grave
stood
two
military
surgeons
or
feldscherers
from
belgrade
and
a
drummerboy
who
held
their
case
of
instruments
the
boy
looked
on
with
keen
interest
and
when
the
coffin
was
exposed
and
rather
roughly
drawn
out
of
the
grave
his
pale
face
and
bright
intent
eye
showed
how
the
scene
moved
him
the
sexton
lifted
the
lid
of
the
coffin
the
body
had
become
inclined
to
one
side
then
turning
it
straight
ha
ha
what
your
mouth
not
wiped
since
last
nights
work
the
spectators
shuddered
the
drummerboy
sank
forward
fainting
and
upset
the
instrument
case
scattering
its
contents
the
senior
surgeon
infected
with
the
horror
of
the
scene
repressed
a
hasty
exclamation
they
threw
water
on
the
drummerboy
and
he
recovered
but
would
not
leave
the
spot
then
they
inspected
the
body
of
arnod
it
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
dead
a
day
after
handling
it
the
scarfskin
came
off
but
below
were
new
skin
and
new
nails
how
could
they
have
come
there
but
from
this
foul
feeding
the
case
was
clear
enough
there
lay
before
them
the
thing
they
dreadedthe
vampire
so
without
more
ado
they
simply
drove
a
stake
through
poor
arnods
chest
whereupon
a
quantity
of
blood
gushed
forth
and
the
corpse
uttered
a
dreadful
groan
murder
murder
shrieked
the
drummerboy
as
he
rushed
wildly
with
convulsed
gestures
from
the
scene
the
body
of
arnod
was
then
burnt
to
ashes
which
were
returned
to
the
grave
the
authorities
further
staked
and
burnt
the
bodies
of
the
four
others
who
were
supposed
to
have
been
infected
by
arnod
no
mention
is
made
of
the
state
in
which
they
were
found
the
adoption
of
these
decisive
measures
failed
however
entirely
to
extinguish
the
evil
which
continued
still
to
hang
about
the
village
about
five
years
afterwards
it
had
again
become
very
rife
and
many
died
through
it
whereupon
the
authorities
determined
to
make
another
and
a
complete
clearance
of
the
vampire
in
the
cemetery
and
with
that
object
they
had
all
the
graves
to
which
suspicion
attached
opened
and
their
contents
officially
anatomised
and
the
following
are
abridgments
of
the
medical
reports
a
woman
of
the
name

months

three

illness
following

confinement

had
before

death
avowed
that
she
had
anointed
herself
with
the
blood
of
a
vampire
to
liberate
herself
from
his
persecution
nevertheless
she
had
died

body

entirely
free
from
decomposition
on
opening
it
the
chest

with

effused

of
sound
health
the
skin
and

of

stated
to

about
there
was
a
local
epidemic
of
vampirism
in
one
of
the
villages
of
bulgaria
when
the
place
became
so
infested
by
them
that
the
inhabitants
were
forced
to
assemble
together
in
two
or
three
houses
burn
candles
at
night
and
watch
by
turns

of

enterprising
of

an
old
lady
suspected
of
witchcraft
discovered

laid
the
troublesome
spirit

credited
with

vampire
belief
in
russia
the
slavonic
belief
in
vampires
is
one
of
the
characteristic
features
of
their
creed
the
little
russians
hold
that
if
the
vampires
hands
have
grown
numb
from
remaining
long
crossed
in
the
grave
he
makes
use
of
his
teeth
which
are
like
steel
when
he
has
gnawed
his
way
with
these
through
all
obstacles
he
first
destroys
the
babies
he
finds
in
a
house
and
afterwards
the
older
inmates
if
fine
salt
be
scattered
on
the
floor
of
a
room
the
vampires
footsteps
may
be
traced
to
his
grave
in
which
he
will
be
found
resting
with
rosy
cheek
and
gory
mouth
the
kashoubes
say
that
when
a
vieszcy
as
they
call
a
vampire
wakes
from
his
sleep
within
the
grave
he
begins
to
gnaw
his
hands
and
feet
and
as
he
gnaws
first
his
relatives
and
then
his
neighbours
sicken
and
die
when
he
has
finished
his
own
store
of
flesh
he
rises
at
midnight
and
destroys
cattle
or
climbs
a
belfry
and
sounds
the
bell
all
who
hear
the
illomened
tones
will
soon
die
generally
he
sucks
the
blood
of
sleepers
ralston
in
his
songs
of
the
russian
people
says
that
it
is
in
the
ukraine
and
in
white
russiaso
far
as
the
russian
empire
is
concernedthat
traditions
are
most
rife
about
this
ghastly
creation
of
morbid
fancy
and
that
the
little
russians
attribute
the
birth
of
a
vampire
to
an
unholy
union
between
a
witch
and
a
werwolf
or
a
devil
he
relates
the
following
as
a
specimen
of
the
vampire
stories
prevalent
in
the
country
a
peasant
was
driving
past
a
graveyard
after
it
had
grown
dark
after
him
came
running
a
stranger
dressed
in
a
red
shirt
and
a
new
jacket
who
said
stop
take
me
as
your
companion
pray
take
a
seat
they
enter
a
village
drive
up
to
this
and
that
house
though
the
gates
are
wide
open
yet
the
stranger
says
shut
tight
for
on
those
gates
crosses
have
been
branded
they
drive
on
to
the
very
last
house
the
gates
are
barred
and
from
them
hangs
a
padlock
weighing
a
score
of
pounds
but
there
is
no
cross
there
and
the
gates
open
of
their
own
accord
they
go
into
the
house
there
on
the
bench
lie
two
sleepersan
old
man
and
a
lad
the
stranger
takes
a
pail
places
it
near
the
youth
and
strikes
him
on
the
back
immediately
the
back
opens
and
forth
flows
rosy
blood
the
stranger
fills
the
pail
full
and
drinks
it
dry
then
he
fills
another
pail
with
blood
from
the
old
man
slakes
his
brutal
thirst
and
says
to
the
peasant
it
begins
to
grow
light
let
us
go
back
to
my
dwelling
in
a
twinkling
they
find
themselves
at
the
graveyard
the
vampire
would
have
clasped
the
peasant
in
his
arms
but
luckily
for
him
the
cocks
begin
to
crow
and
the
corpse
disappears
the
next
morning
when
folks
come
and
look
the
old
man
and
the
lad
are
dead
according
to
the
servians
and
bulgarians
unclean
spirits
enter
into
the
corpses
of
malefactors
and
other
evilly
disposed
persons
who
then
become
vampires
in
some
places
the
jumping
of
a
boy
over
the
corpse
is
considered
as
fatal
as
that
of
a
cat
there
is
a
story
told
of
a
mother
who
lived
in
saratof
who
cursed
her
son
and
his
body
remained
free
from
corruption
after
burial
for
a
hundred
years
when
it
was
disinterred
his
aged
mother
who
is
said
to
have
been
still
alive
pronounced
his
pardon
and
at
that
very
moment
the
corpse
crumbled
into
dust
the
russians
say
that
when
driving
a
stake
into
the
body
of
a
vampire
this
must
be
done
by
one
single
blow
as
a
second
blow
will
reanimate
the
corpse
one
group
of
russian
stories
relate
to
the
sudden
resuscitation
shortly
after
death
of
wizards
and
witches
at
midnight
possessed
with
the
longing
to
eat
the
flesh
of
the
watchers
around
the
bier
the
stories
go
that
the
body
of
the
suspected
witch
was
generally
enclosed
in
a
coffin
which
was
secured
with
iron
bands
and
carried
to
the
church
and
a
watcher
was
appointed
to
read
aloud
from
the
scriptures
over
the
coffin
right
through
each
night
until
burial
it
was
also
the
duty
of
the
watcher
to
draw
on
the
floor
a
magic
circle
within
which
he
must
stand
and
hold
in
his
hand
a
hammer
the
ancient
weapon
of
the
thundergod
if
the
suspicion
that
the
individual
was
a
wizard
or
witch
was
a
correct
one
a
mighty
wind
would
arise
one
night
about
twelve
oclock
the
iron
bands
of
the
coffin
would
give
way
with
a
terrible
crash
the
coffinlid
fall
off
and
the
corpse
leap
forth
and
uttering
a
terrible
screech
rush
at
the
watcher
who
if
he
had
not
taken
the
prescribed
precautions
would
fall
a
victim
to
the
monster
and
in
the
morning
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
him
but
his
bare
bones
the
following
story
of
this
character
is
contained
in
the
records
of
the
kharkof
government
once
in
the
days
of
old
there
died
a
terrible
sinner
his
body
was
taken
into
the
church
and
the
sacristan
was
told
to
read
some
psalms
over
him
he
took
the
precaution
to
catch
a
cock
and
carry
it
with
him
to
the
church
at
midnight
the
dead
man
leaped
from
his
coffin
opened
wide
his
jaws
and
rushed
at
his
victim
but
at
that
moment
the
sacristan
gave
the
bird
a
hard
pinch
the
cock
uttered
his
usual
crow
and
at
the
same
moment
the
dead
man
fell
backwards
to
the
ground
a
numb
motionless
corpse
the
following
story
is
also
given
by
ralston
in
his
collection
of
russian
folkstories
the
coffin
lid
a
moujik
was
driving
along
one
night
with
a
load
of
pots
his
horse
grew
tired
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
came
to
a
standstill
alongside
of
a
graveyard
the
moujik
unharnessed
his
horse
and
set
it
free
to
graze
meanwhile
he
laid
himself
down
on
one
of
the
graves
but
somehow
he
didnt
go
to
sleep
he
remained
there
some
time
suddenly
the
grave
began
to
open
beneath
him
he
felt
the
movement
and
sprang
to
his
feet
the
grave
having
opened
out
of
it
came
a
corpse
wrapped
in
a
white
shroud
and
holding
a
coffin
lid
he
ran
to
the
church
laid
the
coffin
lid
at
the
door
and
then
set
off
for
the
village
the
moujik
was
a
daring
fellow
he
picked
up
the
coffin
lid
and
remained
standing
beside
his
cart
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
after
a
short
delay
the
dead
man
came
back
and
was
going
to
snatch
up
his
coffin
lidbut
it
was
not
to
be
seen
then
the
corpse
began
to
track
it
out
traced
it
up
to
the
moujik
and
said

coals
into
a

and
put

piece
of

with
them
and
then
lock
the
door
the
lads
will
be
revived
by
the
smoke
immediately
the
moujik
cut
off
the
left
skirt
of
the
shroud
and
gave
up
the
coffin
lid
the
corpse
went
to
its
gravethe
grave
opened
but
just
as
the
dead
man
was
descending
into
it
all
of
a
sudden
the
cocks
began
to
crow
and
he
had
not
time
to
get
properly
covered
over
one
end
of
the
coffin
lid
remained
standing
out
of
the
ground
the
moujik
saw
all
this
and
made
a
note
of
it
the
day
began
to
dawn
he
harnessed
his
horse
and
drove
into
the
village
in
one
of
the
houses
he
heard
cries
and
wailing
in
he
wentthere
lay
two
dead
lads

he
i

kinsman
said
their
relatives
well
give
you
half
of
all
we
possess
the
moujik
did
everything
as
the
corpse
had
instructed
him
and
the
lads
came
back
to
life
their
relatives
were
delighted
but
they
immediately
seized
the
moujik
and
bound
him
with
cords
saying
no
no
trickster
well
hand
you
over
to
the
authorities
since
you
know
how
to
bring
them
back
to
life
maybe
it
was
you
who
killed
them
what
are
you
thinking
about
true
believers
have
the
fear
of
god
before
your
eyes
cried
the
moujik
then
he
told
them
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
during
the
night
well
they
spread
the
news
through
the
village
and
the
whole
population
assembled
and
stormed
into
the
graveyard
they
found
the
grave
from
which
the
dead
man
had
come
out
they
tore
it
open
and
they
drove
an
aspen
stake
right
into
the
heart
of
the
corpse
so
that
it
might
no
more
rise
up
and
slay
but
they
rewarded
the
moujik
handsomely
and
sent
him
home
with
great
honour
the
soldier
and
the
vampire
a
certain
soldier
was
allowed
to
go
home
on
furlough
well
he
walked
and
walked
and
walked
and
after
a
time
he
began
to
draw
near
to
his
native
village
not
far
off
from
that
village
lived
a
miller
in
his
mill
in
old
times
the
soldier
had
been
very
intimate
with
him
why
shouldnt
he
go
and
see
his
friend
he
went
the
miller
received
him
cordially
and
at
once
brought
out
liquor
and
the
two
began
drinking
and
chattering
about
their
ways
and
doings
all
this
took
place
towards
nightfall
and
the
soldier
stopped
so
long
at
the
millers
that
it
grew
quite
dark
when
he
proposed
to
start
for
his
village
his
host
exclaimed
spend
the
night

is
very
late
now
and
perhaps
you
may
run
into
mischief
how
so
god
is
punishing
us
a
terrible
warlock
has
died
among
us
and
by
night
he
rises
from
his
grave
wanders
through
the
village
and
does
such
things
as
bring
fear
upon
the
very
bailiffs
and
so
how
could
you
help
being
afraid
of
him
not
a
bit
of
it
a
soldier
is
a
man
who
belongs
to
the
crown
and
crown

be
drowned

be
off

am
tremendously
anxious
to
see
my
people
as
soon

possible
off
he
set
his
road
lay
in
front
of
a
graveyard
on
one
of
the
graves
he
saw
a
great
fire
blazing
what
is
that
then
he
said
lets
have
a
look
when
he
drew
near
he
saw
that
the
warlock
was
sitting
at
the
fire
sewing
boots
hail
brother
calls
out
the
soldier
the
warlock
looked
up
and
said

here
for
why
i
wanted
to
see
what
you
were
doing
the
warlock
threw
his
work
aside
and
invited
the
soldier
to
a
wedding

and
treated
with
the
utmost
hospitality
the
warlock
drank
and
drank
revelled
and
revelled
and
then
grew
angry
he
chased
all
the
guests
and
relatives
out
of
the
house
threw
the
wedded
pair
into
a
slumber
took
out
two
phials
and
an
awl
pierced
the
hands
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
with
the
awl
and
began
drawing
off
their
blood
having
done
this
he
said
to
the
soldier
now
lets
be
off
accordingly
they
went
off
on
the
way
the
soldier
said
tell
me
why
did
you
draw
off
their
blood
in
those
phials
why
in
order
that
the
bride
and
bridegroom
might
die
tomorrow
morning
no
one
will
be
able
to
wake
them
i
alone
know
how
to
bring
them
back
to
life
hows
that
managed
the
bride
and
bridegroom
must
have
cuts
made
in
their
heels
and
some
of
their
blood
must
then
be
poured
back
into
these
wounds
ive
got
the
bridegrooms
blood
stowed
away
in
my
righthand
pocket
and
the
brides
in
my
left
the
soldier
listened
to
this
without
letting
a
single
word
escape
him
then
the
warlock
began
boasting
again
whatever
i
wish
says
he
that
i
can
do
i
suppose
its
quite
impossible
to
get
the
better
of
you
says
the
soldier
impossible
if
anyone
were
to
make
a
pyre
of
aspen
boughs
a
hundred
loads
of
them
and
were
to
burn
me
on
that
pyre
then
hed
be
able
to
get
the
better
of
me
only
hed
have
to
look
sharp
in
burning
me
for
snakes
and
worms
and
different
kinds
of
reptiles
would
creep
out
of
my
inside
and
crows
and
magpies
and
jackdaws
would
come
flying
up
all
these
must
be
caught
and
flung
on
the
pyre
if
so
much
as
a
single
maggot
were
to
escape
then
thered
be
no
help
for
it
in
that
maggot
i
should
slip
away
the
soldier
listened
to
all
this
and
did
not
forget
it
he
and
the
warlock
talked
and
talked
and
at
last
they
arrived
at
the
grave
well
brother
said
the
warlock
now

yourself
for

serve
god
and
the
empire
the
warlock
gnashed
his
teeth
howled
aloud
and
sprang
at
the
soldier
who
drew
his
sword
and
began
laying
about
him
with
sweeping
blows
they
struggled
and
struggled
the
soldier
was
all
but
at
the
end
of
his
strength
ah
thinks
he
im
a
lost
man
and
all
for
nothing
suddenly
the
cocks
began
to
crow
the
warlock
fell
lifeless
to
the
ground
the
soldier
took
the
phials
of
blood
out
of
the
warlocks
pockets
and
went
to
the
house
of
his
own
people
when
he
had
got
there
and
exchanged
greetings
with
his
relatives

on
in
the
village
a
warlock
has
taken
to
haunting
it
after
talking
a
while
they
lay
down
to
sleep
the
next
morning
the
soldier
awoke
and
began
asking

a
wedding

on
somewhere
here
there
was
a
wedding

rich
moujik

very
nightwhat

nobody

moujik

they
showed
him
the
house
thither
he
went
without
speaking
a
word
when
he
got
there
he
found
the
whole
family
in
tears

state

they
i
can

your
young
people
to
life
again
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
do
take
what
you
like
even
were
it
half
of
what
we
have
got
the
soldier
did
as
the
warlock
had
instructed
him
and
brought
the
young
people
back
to
life
instead
of
weeping
there
began
to
be
happiness
and
rejoicing
the
soldier
was
hospitably
treated
and
well
rewarded
thenleft
about
face
off
he
marched
to
starosta
and
told
the
burgomaster
to
call
the
peasants
together
and
to
get
ready
a
hundred
loads
of
aspen
wood
well
they
took
the
wood
into
the
graveyard
dragged
the
warlock
out
of
his
grave
placed
him
on
the
pyre
and
set
it
in
flames
the
warlock
began
to
burn
his
corpse
burst
and
out
of
it
came
snakes
worms
and
all
kinds
of
reptiles
and
up
came
flying
crows
magpies
and
jackdaws
the
peasants
knocked
them
down
and
flung
them
into
the
fire
not
allowing
so
much
as
a
single
maggot
to
creep
away
and
so
the
warlock
was
thoroughly
consumed
and
the
soldier
collected
his
ashes
and
strewed
them
to
the
winds
from
that
time
there
was
peace
in
the
village
the
soldier
received
the
thanks
of
the
whole
community
in
russian
folklore
there
is
a
class
of
demons
known
as
heart
devourers
who
touch
their
victim
with
an
aspen
or
other
twig
credited
with
magical
properties
the
heart
then
falls
out
and
may
be
replaced
by
some
baser
one
there
is
a
moscovian
story
in
which
a
hero
awakes
with
the
heart
of
a
hare
the
work
of
a
demon
while
the
man
was
asleep
he
remained
a
coward
for
the
rest
of
his
life
in
another
instance
a
very
quiet
reserved
inoffensive
peasant
received
a
cocks
heart
in
exchange
for
his
own
and
afterwards
was
for
ever
crowing
like
a
healthy
bird
the
following
is
taken
from
the
lettres
juives
of
in
the
beginning
of
september
there
died
in
the
village
of
kisilova
three
leagues
from
graditz
an
old
man
who
was
sixtytwo
years
of
age
three
days
after
he
had
been
buried
he
appeared
in
the
night
to
his
son
and
asked
him
for
something
to
eat
the
son
having
given
him
something
he
ate
and
disappeared
the
next
day
the
son
recounted
to
his
neighbours
what
had
happened
that
night
the
father
did
not
appear
but
the
following
night
he
showed
himself
and
asked
for
something
to
eat
they
know
not
whether
the
son
gave
him
anything
or
not
but
the
next
day
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
on
the
same
day
five
or
six
persons
fell
suddenly
ill
in
the
village
and
died
one
after
the
other
in
a
few
days
the
officer
or
bailiff
of
the
place
when
informed
of
what
had
happened
sent
an
account
of
it
to
the
tribunal
of
belgrade
which
despatched
to
the
village
two
of
these
officers
and
an
executioner
to
examine
into
this
affair
the
imperial
officer
from
whom
we
have
this
account
repaired
thither
from
graditz
to
be
a
witness
of
what
took
place
they
opened
the
graves
of
those
who
had
been
dead
six
weeks
when
they
came
to
that
of
the
old
man
they
found
him
with
his
eyes
open
having
a
fine
colour
with
natural
respiration
nevertheless
motionless
as
the
dead
whence
they
concluded
that
he
was
most
undoubtedly
a
vampire
the
executioner
drove
a
stake
into
his
heart
they
then
raised
a
pile
and
reduced
the
corpse
to
ashes
no
mark
of
vampirism
was
found
either
on
the
corpse
of
the
son
or
on
the
others
the
following
story
is
told
by
madame
blavatsky
in
isis
unveiled
who
states
that
she
had
the
account
from
an
eyewitness
of
the
occurrence
about
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
there
occurred
in
russia
one
of
the
most
frightful
cases
of
vampirism
on
record
the
governor
of
the
province
of
tch
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
years
of
age
of
a
cruel
and
jealous
disposition
clothed
with
despotic
authority
he
exercised
it
without
stint
as
his
brutal
instincts
prompted
he
fell
in
love
with
the
pretty
daughter
of
a
subordinate
officer
although
the
girl
was
betrothed
to
a
young
man
whom
she
loved
the
tyrant
forced
her
father
to
consent
to
his
having
her
marry
him
and
the
poor
victim
despite
her
despair
became
his
wife
his
jealous
disposition
soon
exhibited
itself
he
beat
her
confined
her
to
her
room
for
weeks
together
and
prevented
her
seeing
anyone
except
in
his
presence
he
finally
fell
sick
and
died
finding
his
end
approaching
he
made
her
swear
never
to
marry
again
and
with
fearful
oaths
threatened
that
in
case
she
did
he
would
return
from
his
grave
and
kill
her
he
was
buried
in
the
cemetery
across
the
river
and
the
young
widow
experienced
no
further
annoyance
until
getting
the
better
of
her
fears
she
listened
to
the
importunities
of
her
former
lover
and
they
were
again
betrothed
on
the
night
of
the
customary
betrothal
feast
when
all
had
retired
the
old
mansion
was
aroused
by
shrieks
proceeding
from
her
room
the
doors
were
burst
open
and
the
unhappy
woman
was
found
lying
on
her
bed
in
a
swoon
at
the
same
time
a
carriage
was
heard
rumbling
out
of
the
courtyard
her
body
was
found
to
be
black
and
blue
in
places
as
from
the
effect
of
pinches
and
from
a
slight
puncture
in
her
neck
drops
of
blood
were
oozing
upon
recovering
she
stated
that
her
deceased
husband
had
suddenly
entered
her
room
appearing
exactly
as
in
life
with
the
exception
of
a
dreadful
pallor
that
he
had
upbraided
her
for
her
inconstancy
and
then
beaten
and
pinched
her
most
cruelly
her
story
was
disbelieved
but
the
next
morning
the
guard
stationed
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
which
spans
the
river
reported
that
just
before
midnight
a
black
coachandsix
had
driven
furiously
past
without
answering
their
challenge
the
new
governor
who
disbelieved
the
story
of
the
apparition
took
nevertheless
the
precaution
of
doubling
the
guards
across
the
bridge
the
same
thing
happened
however
night
after
night
the
soldiers
declaring
that
the
tollbar
at
their
station
near
the
bridge
would
rise
of
itself
and
the
spectral
equipage
would
sweep
past
them
despite
their
efforts
to
stop
it
at
the
same
time
every
night
the
watchers
including
the
widows
family
and
the
servants
would
be
thrown
into
a
heavy
sleep
and
every
morning
the
young
victim
would
be
found
bruised
bleeding
and
swooning
as
before
the
town
was
thrown
into
consternation
the
physicians
had
no
explanations
to
offer
priests
came
to
pass
the
night
in
prayer
but
as
midnight
approached
all
would
be
seized
with
the
same
terrible
lethargy
finally
the
archbishop
of
the
province
came
and
performed
the
ceremony
of
exorcism
in
person
on
the
following
morning
the
governors
widow
was
found
worse
than
ever
she
was
now
brought
to
deaths
door
the
governor
was
finally
driven
to
take
the
severest
measures
to
stop
the
everincreasing
panic
in
the
town
he
stationed
fifty
cossacks
along
the
bridge
with
orders
to
stop
the
spectral
carriage
at
all
hazards
promptly
at
the
usual
hour
it
was
heard
and
seen
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
a
priest
bearing
a
crucifix
planted
themselves
in
front
of
the
tollbar
and
together
shouted
in
the
name
of
god
and
the
czar
who
goes
there
out
of
the
coach
was
thrust
a
wellremembered
head
and
a
familiar
voice
responded
the
privy
councillor
of
state
and
governor
c
at
the
same
moment
the
officer
the
priest
and
the
soldiers
were
flung
aside
as
by
an
electric
shock
and
the
ghostly
equipage
passed
them
before
they
could
recover
breath
the
archbishop
then
resolved
as
a
last
expedient
to
resort
to
the
timehonoured
plan
of
exhuming
the
body
and
driving
an
oaken
stake
through
its
heart
this
was
done
with
great
religious
ceremony
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
populace
the
story
is
that
the
body
was
found
gorged
with
blood
and
with
red
cheeks
and
lips
at
the
instant
that
the
first
blow
was
struck
upon
the
stake
a
groan
issued
from
the
corpse
and
a

was
surprised
that
in
the

eighteenth
century
there
should
still
be
people
found
who
believed
in
the
reality
of
vampires
and
that
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
should
give
their
imprimatur
to
a
dissertation
on
these
unpleasant
creatures
yet
from
to
the
subject
of
vampirism
formed
a
principal
topic
of
conversation
and
may
be
said
to
have
been
a
mania
all
over
the
world
with
europe
as
a
particular
centre
pamphlets
on
the

from
the
press
the
newspapers
vied
with
one
another
in
recording
fresh
achievements
of
the
spectres
and
though
the
philosophers
scoffed
at
and
ridiculed
the
belief
yet
sovereigns
sent
officers
and
commissioners
to
report
upon
their
misdeeds
the
favourite
scenes
of
their
exploits
were
hungary
poland
silesia
bohemia
and
moravia
and
in
those
countries
a
vampire
haunted
and
tormented
almost
every
village
in
some
parts
of
scandinavia
a
singular
method
was
adopted
for
getting
rid
of
vampires
viz
by
instituting
judicial
proceedings
against
them
inhabitants
were
regularly
summoned
to
attend
the
inquest
a
tribunal
was
constituted
charges
were
preferred
with
the
usual
legal
formalities
accusing
them
of
molesting
the
houses
and
introducing
death
among
the
inhabitants
and
at
the
end
of
the
proceedings
judgment
was
proclaimed
the
priest
then
entered
with
holy
water
mass
was
celebrated
and
it
was
held
that
complete
conquest
had
been
gained
over
the

sir
walter
scott
in
his
translation
of

relates
a
traditional
story
of
several
vampires
who
committed
dreadful
ravages
in
iceland
in
the
year
so
that
in
a

book
i
dealing
with
the
origin
of
the
danes
relates
the
following
story
one
mithothin
who
was
famous
for
his
juggling
tricks
was
quickened
as
though
by
an
inspiration
from
on
high
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
feigning
to
be
a
god
and
wrapping
the
minds
of
the
barbarians
in
fresh
darkness
he
led
them
by
the
renown
of
his
jugglings
to
pay
holy
observance
to
his
name
he
said
that
the
wrath
of
the
gods
could
never
be
appeased
nor
the
outrage
to
their
deity
expiated
by
mixed
and
indiscriminate
sacrifices
and
therefore
forbade
that
prayers
for
this
end
should
be
put
up
without
distinction
appointing
to
each
of
those
above
his
especial
drinkoffering
but
when
odin
was
returning
he
cast
away
all
help
of
jugglings
went
to
finland
to
hide
himself
and
was
there
attacked
and
slain
by
the
inhabitants
even
in
his
death
his
abominations
were
made
manifest
for
those
who
came
nigh
his
barrow
were
cut
off
by
a
kind
of
sudden
death
and
after
his
end
he
spread
such
pestilence
that
he
seemed
almost
to
leave
a
filthier
record
in
his
death
than
in
his
life
it
was
as
though
he
would
extort
from
the
guilty
a
punishment
for
his
slaughter
the
inhabitants
being
in
this
trouble
took
the
body
out
of
the
mound
beheaded
it
and
impaled
it
through

willingly
lingers
for

codrington
in
his
descriptive
work
on
the
melanesians
says
that
there
is
a
belief
in
banks
islands
in
the
existence
of
a
power
like
that
of
vampires
a
man
or
a
woman
would
obtain
this
power
out
of
a
morbid
desire
for
communion
with
some
ghost
and
in
order
to
gain
it
would
steal
and
eat
a
morsel
of
a
corpse
the
ghost
of
the
dead
man
would
then
join
in
a
close
friendship
with
the
person
who
had
eaten
and
would
gratify
him
by
afflicting
anyone
against
whom
his
ghostly
power
might
be
directed
the
man
so
afflicted
would
feel
that
something
was
influencing
his
life
and
would
come
to
dread
some
particular
person
among
his
neighbours
who
was
therefore
suspected
of
being
a
talamur
this
name
was
also
given
to
one
whose
soul
was
supposed
to
go
out
and
eat
the
soul
or
lingering
life
of
a
freshly
dead
corpse
there
was
a
woman
some
years
ago
of
whom
the
story
is
told
that
she
made
no
secret
of
doing
this
and
that
once
on
the
death
of
a
neighbour
she
gave
notice
that
she
should
go
in
the
night
and
eat
the
corpse
the
friends
of
the
deceased
therefore
kept
watch
in
the
house
where
the
corpse
lay
and
at
dead
of
night
heard
a
scratching
at
the
door
followed
by
a
rustling
noise
close
by
the
corpse
one
of
them
threw
a
stone
and
seemed
to
hit
the
unknown
thing
and
in
the
morning
the
talamur
was
found
with
a
bruise
on
her
arm

she
confessed
was
caused
by

thrown
at

baron
von
haxthausen
in
his
work
on
transcaucasia
tells
us
that
there
once
dwelt
in
a
cavern
in
armenia
a
vampire
called
dakhanavar
who
could
not
endure
anyone
to
penetrate
into
the
mountains
of
ulmish
altotem
or
count
their
valleys
everyone
who
attempted
this
had
in
the
night
his
blood
sucked
by
the
monster
from
the
soles
of
his
feet
until
he
died
the
vampire
was
however
at
last
outwitted
by
two
cunning
fellows
they
began
to
count
the
valleys
and
when
night
came
on
they
lay
down
to
sleeptaking
care
to
place
themselves
with
the
feet
of
the
one
under
the
head
of
the
other
in
the
night
the
monster
came
felt
as
usual
and
found
a
head
then
he
felt
at
the
other
end
and
found
a
head
there
also
well
cried
he
i
have
gone
through
the
whole
valleys
of
these
mountains
and
have
sucked
the
blood
of
people
without
end
but
never
yet
did
i
come
across
anyone
with
two
heads
and
no
feet
so
saying
he
ran
away
and
was
never
more
seen
in
that
country

ever
after
the
people
knew

preliminary
inquest
he
ordered
the
corpse
to
be
coffined
had
the
woman
put
in
fetters
and
examined
her
so
he
put
her
in
gaol
and
many
months
passed
away
without
sentence
being
pronounced
then
a
neighbour
coming
uphill
for
some
fuel
saw
a
neglected
grave
with
a
coffin
lid
bare
it
was
quite
a
sound
coffin
strong
and
solid
and
yet
the
lid
was
raised
a
little
so
he
naturally
suspected
that
it
had
been
opened
by
thieves
he
summoned
the
people
they
lifted
the
lid
off
and
saw
a
corpse
with
features
like
a
living
person
and
a
body
covered
with
white
hair
between
its
arms
it
held
the
head
of
a
man
which
they
recognised
as
that
of
liu
the
graduate
they
reported
the
case
to
the
magistrate
the
coroners
ordered
the
head
to
be
taken
away
but
it
was
so
firmly
grasped
in
the
arms
of
the
corpse
that
the
combined
efforts
of
a
number
of
men
proved
insufficient
to
draw
it
out
so
the
magistrate
told
them
to
chop
off
the
arms
of
the
kiangshi
corpsespectre
fresh
blood
gushed
out
of
the
wounds
but
in
lius
head
there
was
not
a
drop
left
it
having
been
sucked
dry
by
the
monster
by
magisterial
order
the
corpse
was
burned
and
the

ended
with

the

distinct
and
separate
from
the
dead
species
in

and

there
is
a
belief
in
living
vampires
who
leave
their
shepherd
dwellings
by
night
and
roam
about
biting
and
tearing

tail
they
roam
through

and
their
main
delight
is
to
kill
cattle
in
some
countries
the
belief
prevails
that
the
soul
of
a
living
man
often
of
a
sorcerer
leaves
its
proper
body
asleep
and
goes
forth
perhaps
in
visible
form
of
a
straw
or
fluff
of
down
slips
through
the
keyholes

the
following
account
was
contributed
by
me
to
the
occult
review
for
july
the
particulars
are
given
exactly
as
i
wrote
them
down
in
shorthand
from
the
narrators
dictation
my
informant
is
a
wellknown
medical
practitioner
in
the
west
end
of
london
who
has
held
various
official
appointments
in
the
tropics
and
i
received
his
assurance
that
the
incidents
recorded
happened
exactly
as
they
are
described
whether
the
indian
referred
to
is
still
alive
or
not
is
unknown
but
certainly
the
two
other
principals
at
the
time
of
writing
are
some
years
ago
a
small
number
of
english
officials
were
stationed
in
a
small
place
in
the
tropics
their
residences
were
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
each
other
three
of
the
bungalows
standing
in
their
own
compounds
and
on
separate
elevations
suddenly
one
of
the
officials
fell
ill
but
the
district
medical
officer
was
quite
unable
to
trace
the
cause
of
the
illness
the
official
in
question
made
several
applications
to
the
colonial
office
for
transfer
to
another
station
saying
he
felt
he
should
die
if
he
remained
there
at
first
the
application
was
refused
but
the
man
got
worse
and
fell
into
a
very
depressed
mental
condition
he
eventually
wrote
again
saying
that
if
his
application
for
transfer
could
not
be
granted
he
would
be
compelled
to
throw
up
his
appointmenta
serious
matter
for
him
as
he
had
no
private
means
the
application
was
then
granted
he
was
transferred
and
he
recovered
his
health
about
eighteen
months
later
another
official
had
a
slight
attack
of
fever
from
which
he
fully
recovered
but
after
this
attack
he
began
to
complain
of
lassitude
until
he
went
beyond
a
certain
distance
from
his
residence
the
moment
he
returned
to
within
this
distance
he
said
he
felt
as
though
a
wet
blanket
had
been
thrown
over
him
and
nothing
could
rouse
him
from
the
depression
which
seized
him
he
too
fell
into
a
low
state
of
health
and
on
his
request
was
transferred
to
another
station
shortly
after
this
transfer
the
wife
of
the
district
medical
officer
living
within
the
same
area
began
to
fail
in
health
and
became
terribly
depressed
apparently
from
no
cause
whatever
previously
she
had
been
a
cheerful
happy
woman
indulging
in
games
and
outdoor
sports
of
all
kinds
but
now
she
became
most
depressed
and
miserable
at
last
one
night
about
twelve
oclock
she
woke
up
shrieking
her
husband
rushed
into
her
room
and
she
said
she
had
woken
up
with
a
most
awful
feeling
of
depression
and
had
seen
a
creature
travelling
along
the
cornice
of
the
room
she
could
only
describe
it
as
having
a
resemblance
to
something
between
a
gigantic
spider
and
a
huge
jellyfish
her
husband
ascribed
it
to
an
attack
of
nightmare
but
he
was
disturbed
in
the
same
manner
on
the
following
night
when
his
wife
said
she
had
been
awake
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
had
not
had
the
strength
to
call
him
before
he
found
her
in
a
state
of
collapse
pulse
exceedingly
low
temperature
three
degrees
below
normal
pallid
and
in
a
cold
sweat
he
mixed
her
a
draught
which
had
the
effect
of
sending
her
to
sleep
in
the
morning
she
said
she
must
leave
the
station
and
go
home
as
to
stop
there
would
mean
her
death
thinking
to
divert
her
attention
her
husband
took
her
away
on
a
pleasure
trip
when
he
was
glad
to
see
that
she
entirely
recovered
her
former
cheerful
expression
and
high
spirits
this
state
of
things
lasted
until
returning
home
in
a
rickshaw
alongside
her
husbands
her
face
changed
and
she
resumed
her
gloomy
countenance
there
she
said
is
it
not
awful
i
have
been
so
well
and
happy
all
the
week
and
now
i
feel
as
though
a
pall
had
been
thrown
over
me
matters
got
worse
and
she
became
more
depressed
than
ever
and
only
a
few
nights
passed
before
her
husband
was
again
called
to
her
bedside
about
midnight
he
found
his
wife
in
a
state
of
considerable
weakness
although
it
was
not
so
acute
as
on
the
previous
occasion
she
said
to
him
i
want
you
to
examine
the
back
of
my
neck
and
shoulders
very
carefully
and
see
if
there
is
any
mark
on
the
skin
of
any
kind
whatever
her
husband
did
so
but
could
not
find
a
mark
get
a
glass
and
look
again
see
if
you
can
find
any
puncture
from
a
sharppointed
tooth
he
made
a
microscopical
examination
but
found
absolutely
nothing
now
said
his
wife
i
can
tell
you
what
is
the
matter
i
dreamed
that
i
was
in
a
house
where
i
lived
when
i
was
a
girl
my
little
boy
called
out
to
me
i
ran
down
to
him
but
when
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
a
tall
black
man
came
towards
me
i
waved
him
off
but
i
could
not
move
to
get
away
from
him
though
i
pushed
the
boy
out
of
his
reach
the
man
came
towards
me
seized
me
in
his
arms
sat
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
put
me
on
his
knee
and
proceeded
to
suck
from
a
point
at
the
upper
part
of
the
spine
just
below
the
neck
i
felt
that
he
was
drawing
all
the
blood
and
life
out
of
me
then
he
threw
me
from
him
and
apparently
i
lost
consciousness
as
he
did
so
i
felt
as
though
i
was
dying
then
i
woke
up
and
i
had
been
lying
here
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
before
i
was
able
to
call
you
have
you
ever
experienced
anything
of
this
character
before
asked
her
husband
no
i
have
not
but
night
after
night
for
many
months
i
have
woken
up
in
exactly
the
same
state
and
that
has
been
the
sole
cause
of
my
mental
depression
i
have
not
said
anything
about
it
because
it
seemed
so
foolish
but
now
i
have
had
this
definite
dream
i
cannot
hold
my
tongue
any
longer
she
soon
passed
into
a
peaceful
sleep
and
on
discussing
the
matter
the
following
morning
with
her
husband
she
said
i
have
a
feeling
somehow
that
it
will
not
happen
again
i
feel
quite
well
and
strong
and
all
my
depression
is
gone
in
the
afternoon
husband
and
wife
were
going
together
to
the
club
when
around
the
corner
of
the
jungle
came
a
tall
indian
the
owner
of
a
large
number
of
milch
cattle
and
reputed
to
be
a
wealthy
man
the
surgeons
wife
suddenly
stopped
turned
pale
and
said
immediately
that
is
the
man
i
saw
in
my
dream
the
husband
went
directly
up
to
the
man
and
said
to
him
look
here
i
will
give
you
twelve
hours
to
get
out
of
this
place
i
know
everything
that
happened
last
night
at
midnight
and
i
will
kill
you
like
a
dog
if
i
find
you
here
in
twelve
hours
time
the
indian
disappeared
the
same
night
taking
with
him
only
a
few
valuables
and
a
little
loose
money
he
left
behind
him
the
money
that
was
deposited
in
the
bank
as
well
as
the
whole
of
his
property
his
forty
head
of
cattle
worth
eighty
dollars
each
were
impounded
and
no
news
had
been
heard
of
him
five
years
afterwards
since
his
departure
no
one
has
complained
of
depression
and
lassitude

that
area

the

in

the
subject
of
vampirism
does
not
appear
to
have
attracted
litterateurs
greatly
true
there
are
the

the

the
foundation
of
his
exciting
romance

mention
of
these
works
almost
exhausts
the
references
to
separate
works
upon
the

tyana
iv
p
says
that
the
long
intercourse
which
took
place
between
a
female
spectre
and
the
corinthian
menippus
was
but
a
prelude
to
the
feast
of
flesh
and
blood
in
which
she
meant
to
revel
after
their
marriage
some
have
described
the
hebrew
lilith
as
a
vampire
but
the
jewish
encyclopdia
states
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
talmud
to
indicate
that
the
lilith
was
a
vampire
she
was
regarded
as
a
nocturnal
demon
flying
about
in
the
form
of
a
nightowl
and
stealing
children
and
was
held
to
have
permission
to
kill
all
children
sinfully
begotten
even
from
a
lawful
wife
the
lilith
is
held
to
have
the
same
signification
as
the
greek
strix
and
lami
who
were
sorceresses
or
magicians
seeking
to
put
to
death
newborn
children
the
ancient
greeks
believed
that
these
lami
devoured
children
or
sucked
away
all
their
blood
until
they
died
euripides
and
the
scholiast
of
aristophanes
mention
the
lilith
as
a
dangerous
monster
the
enemy
of
mortals
and
ovid
describes
the
strig
as
dangerous
birds
which
fly
by
night
and
seek
for
infants
to
devour
them
and
nourish
themselves
with
their
blood
the
aluka
of
proverbs
xxx
is
more
akin
to
the
vampire
it
is
a
bloodsucking
insatiable
monster
the
word
is
synonymous
with
algul
the
wellknown
demon
of
the
arabian
popular
stories
the
mandevouring
demon
of
the
waste
known
as
the
ghoul
or
goule
in
the
translated
edition
of
the
arabian
nights
goethe
in
his
ballad
the
bride
of
corinth
describes
how
a
young
athenian
visits
a
friend
of
his
father
to
whose
daughter
he
had
been
betrothed
and
is
disturbed
at
midnight
by
the
appearance
of
the
vampire
spectre
of
her
whom
death
has
prevented
from
becoming
his
bride
and
who
when
detected
says
from
my
grave
to
wander
i

of

is
referred
to
in
a
footnote
to
southeys
thalaba
the
destroyer
p
ed
in
the
year
a
young
man
of
noble
birth
had
been
married
in
rome
and
during
the
period
of
his
nuptial
feast
having
gone
with
his
companions
to
play
at
ball
he
put
his
marriage
ring
on
the
finger
of
a
broken
statue
of
venus
in
the
area
to
remain
while
he
was
engaged
in
recreation
desisting
from
the
exercise
he
found
the
finger
on
which
he
had
put
his
ring
contracted
firmly
against
the
palm
and
attempted
in
vain
either
to
break
or
disengage
the
ring
he
concealed
the
circumstances
from
his
companions
and
returned
at
night
with
a
servant
when
he
found
the
finger
extended
and
the
ring
gone
he
dissembled
the
loss
and
returned
to
his
wife
but
when
he
attempted
to
embrace
her
he
found
himself
prevented
by
something
dark
and
dense
which
was
tangible
if
not
visible
interposing
between
them
and
he
heard
a
voice
saying
embrace
me
for
i
am
venus
whom
this
day
you
wedded
and
i
will
not
restore
your
ring
as
this
was
constantly
repeated
he
consulted
his
relatives
who
had
recourse
to
palumbus
the
priest
skilled
in
necromancy
he
directed
the
young
man
to
go
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
to
a
spot
among
the
ruins
of
ancient
rome
where
four
roads
meet
and
wait
silently
till
he
saw
a
company
pass
by
and
then
without
uttering
a
word
to
deliver
a
letter
which
he
gave
him
to
a
majestic
being
who
rode
in
a
chariot
after
the
rest
of
the
company
the
young
man
did
as
he
was
directed
and
saw
the
company
of
all
ages
classes
and
ranks
on
horse
and
on
foot
some
joyful
and
others
sad
pass
along
among
whom
he
distinguished
a
woman
in
a
meretricious
dress
who
from
the
tenuity
of
her
garments
seemed
almost
naked
she
rode
on
a
mule
her
long
hair
which
flowed
over
her
shoulders
was
bound
with
a
golden
fillet
and
in
her
hand
was
a
golden
rod
with
which
she
directed
her
mule
in
the
close
of
the
procession
a
tall
majestic
figure
appeared
in
a
chariot
adorned
with
emeralds
and
pearls
who
fiercely
asked
the
young
man
what
he
did
there
he
presented
the
letter
in
silence
which
the
demon
dared
not
refuse
as
soon
as
he
had
read
lifting
up
his
hands
to
heaven
he
exclaimed
almighty
god
how
long
wilt
thou
endure
the
iniquities
of
the
sorcerer
palumbus
and
immediately
despatched
some
of
his
attendants
who
with
much
difficulty
extorted
the
ring
from
venus
and
restored
it
to
its
owner
whose
infernal
banns
were
thus
dissolved

developed
a
theory
which
is
a
novel
one
in
the
annals
of
vampirism
the
principal
character
is
a
living
woman
a
member
of
a
secret
sisterhood
who
is
forced
to
exercise
her
powers
as
a
vampire
to
prevent
loss
of
vitality
this
power
however
is
exercised
through
the
medium
of
a
metallic
talisman
and
the
main
thread
of
the
story
turns
on
the
struggle
for
the
possession
of
this
talisman
it
is
wrested
ultimately
from
the
hands
of
those
who
would
use
it
for
malignant
purposes
but
its
recovery

and
grapple
with
the
vampire
a
single
prick
with
the
pin
sufficed
to
make
her
visible
to
the
human
eye
but
the
seven
nights
watch
had
been
fruitless
for
the
child
wasted
away
and
grew
more
hopelessly
feeble
from
hour
to
hour
at
last
in
despair
the
father
had
consulted
with
a
wizard
by
whose
advice
he
had
called
a
dog
and
put
the
body
behind
the
door
the
vampire
could
not
then
enter
the
house
till
she
counted
every
hair
on
its
body
calmets
explanation
of
the
spectres
so
much
talked
of
in
hungary
moravia
poland
and
elsewhere
is
that
they
are
nothing
but
persons
that
are
still
alive
in
their
graves
though
without
motion
or
respiration
and
that
the
freshness
and
ruddy
colour
of
their
blood
the
flexibility
of
their
limbs
and
their
crying
out
when
their
hearts
were
run
through
with
a
stick
or
their
heads
cut
off
were
demonstrative
proofs
of
their
being
still
alive
but
this
he
says
does
not
affect
the
principal
difficulty
at
which
i
stick
namely
how
they
come
out
of
and
go
into
their
graves
without
leaving
any
mark
of
the
earths
being
removed
and
how
they
appear
to
carry
former
clothes
if
they
are
not
really
dead
why
do
they
return
to
their
graves
again
and
not
stay
in
the
land
of
the
living
why
do
they
suck
the
blood
of
their
relations
and
torment
and
pester
persons
that
should
naturally
be
true
to
them
and
never
give
them
any
offence
on
the
other
hand
if
it
be
nothing
but
a
mere
whim
of
the
persons
infested
whence
comes
it
that
these
carcases
are
found
in
their
graves
uncorrupted
full
of
blood
with
their
limbs
pliant
and
flexible
and
their
feet
dirty
the
next
day
after
they
have
been
patrolling
about
and
frightening
the
neighbourhood
whilst
nothing
of
this
sort
can
be
discovered
in
other
carcases
that
were
buried
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
mound
whence
is
it
that
they
come
no
more
after
they
are
burned
or
impaled
other
writers
have
accepted
the
theory
that
the
subjects
are
not
really
dead
but
are
only
in
a
deathlike
condition
the
germans
express
this
condition
of
apparent
death
and
of
the
perfect
preservation
of
the
living
body
by
the
term
scheintod
which
is
perhaps
better
than
the
english
term
suspended
animation
dr
herbert
mayo
describes
the
special
condition
of
vampires
as
a
deathtrancea
positive
status
a
period
of
repose
the
duration
of
which
is
sometimes
definite
and
predetermined
though
unknown
and
says
that
the
patient
sometimes
awakes
suddenly
when
the
term
of
the
deathtrance
has
expired
during
this
tranceperiod
the
action
of
the
heart

voluntary
motion
as
well
as
feeling
and
intelligence
and
the
vegetable
changes
in
the
body
are
said
to
be
suspended
two
instances
of
the
deathtrance
are
quoted
cardinal
espinosa
prime
minister
under
philip
the
second
of
spain
died
as
it
was
supposed
after
a
short
illness
his
rank
entitled
him
to
be
embalmed
accordingly
the
body
was
opened
for
that
purpose
the
lungs
and
heart
had
just
been
brought
into
view
when
the
latter
was
seen
to
beat
the
cardinal
awakening
at
the
fatal
moment
had
still
strength
enough
left
to
seize
with
his
hand
the
knife
of
the
anatomist
on
the
rd
of
september
the
abb
prvost
the
french
novelist
and
compiler
of
travels
was
seized
with
a
fit
in
the
forest
of
chantilly
the
body
was
found
and
conveyed
to
the
residence
of
the
nearest
clergyman
it
was
supposed
that
death
had
taken
place
through
apoplexy
but
the
local
authorities
desiring
to
be
satisfied
of
the
fact
ordered
the
body
to
be
examined
during
the
process
the
poor
abb
uttered
a
cry
of
agony
it
was
too
late
among
theosophists
and
continental
spiritists
a
solution
to
the
problem
is
found
in
their
teaching
concerning
the
astral
body
and
the
astral
plane
as
conveyed
by
madame
blavatsky
in
isis
unveiled
it
is
held
that
so
long
as
the
astral
form
is
not
entirely
separated
from
the
body
there
is
a
liability
that
it
may
be
forced
by
magnetic
attraction
to
reenter
it
sometimes
it
will
be
only
halfway
out
when
the
corpse
which
presents
the
appearance
of
death
is
buried
in
such
cases
the
astral
body
voluntarily
reenters
the
mortal
frame
and
then
one
of
two
things
happenseither
the
unhappy
victim
will
writhe
in
the
agonising
torture
of
suffocation
or
if
he
has
been
grossly
material
he
becomes
a
vampire
it
is
held
that
this
ethereal
form
can
go
wherever
it
pleases
and
that
it
is
possible
for
this
astral
body
to
feed
on
human
victims
and
carry
the
sustenance
to
the
corpus
lying
within
the
tomb
by
means
of
an
invisible
cord
of
connection
the
nature
of
which
is
at
present
unknown
but
psychical
researchersand
these
number
many
eminent
scientistshave
of
late
years
devoted
their
efforts
towards
the
elucidation
of
the
phenomenon
known
as
the
projection
of
the
double
and
this
if
scientifically
and
satisfactorily
explained
will
give
the
clue
to
many
of
the
phenomena
of
vampirism
this
double
may
sometimes
during
life
be
projected
unconsciously
and
sometimes
purposely
by
means
of
hypnotism
or
provoked
somnambulism
an
example
of
the
former
appeared
in
the
journal
du
magntisme
for
october
and
the
translation
of
the
account
was
published
in

for

is
here
reproduced
the
narrator

m
antonio
salazar
of
mexico
a
romantic
case
of
projection
of
the
double
in
i
lived
at
juatlahuaca
in
the
state
of
oaxaca
mexico
for
a
long
time
i
passionately
loved
the
woman
who
afterwards
became
my
wife
at
the
beginning
of
through
one
of
those
unfortunate
disagreements
which
occasionally
arise
between
parents
and
their
children
those
of
my
beloved
one
wishing
to
put
an
end
to
our
mutual
love
separated
us
by
taking
her
to
the
mountains
but
this
only
increased
our
love
because
of
the
difficulties
and
our
desire
to
see
each
other
several
months
passed
after
our
separation
and
though
the
distance
between
us
was
not
great
we
had
to
take
into
account
the
vigilance
with
which
she
was
surrounded
and
which
was
a
greater
obstacle
than
the
difficulties
of
the
road
one
night
when
i
was
feeling
as
usual
very
sad
and
gloomy
the
thought
came
to
me
to
say
to
my
servant
jeanette
if
any
morning
you
come
into
my
room
and
do
not
find
me
do
not
look
for
me
take
the
keys
and
open
the
shop
if
at
midday
i
have
not
arrived
you
can
seek
for
me
in
the
mountains
ah
sir
she
replied
i
would
never
oppose
myself
to
your
commands
if
what
you
tell
me
did
not
concern
persons
whom
i
love
and
respect
because
you
will
never
thereby
accomplish
your
object
i
knew
that
she
was
right
and
i
thought
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
go
to
sleep
and
try
to
calm
my
imagination
she
also
retired
much
distressed
and
imploring
all
the
saints
to
whom
she
prayed
to
prevent
any
unfortunate
incident
which
would
threaten
the
lives
of
three
personsmy
fiance
her
father
and
myself
the
following
day
i
awoke
with
the
same
project
in
my
mind
but
before
carrying
it
out
i
wished
to
inform
my
fiance
as
to
the
day
and
hour
at
which
i
hoped
to
speak
to
her
she
replied
by
showing
me
the
rashness
of
my
project
and
offering
to
do
all
she
could
to
overcome
the
obstacles
which
prevented
her
from
returning
to
live
in
the
town
which
she
hoped
to
do
in
a
few
days
and
which
came
to
pass
as
she
had
predicted
i
reckoned
however
on
my
sagacity
and
youthful
ardour
to
realise
my
project
before
my
fiance
was
able
to
return
one
day
when
my
mind
was
indulging
itself
in
all
kinds
of
fancies
i
thought
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
all
those
who
were
around
my
fiance
and
who
were
opposed
to
our
meeting
when
night
came
on
i
continued
to
think
of
my
project
and
i
resolved
to
lie
down
and
try
to
sleep
i
passed
a
very
disturbed
night
waking
frequently
and
when
the
day
began
to
break
the
servant
came
to
my
room
to
bid
me
good
morning
and
to
ask
for
the
keys
of
the
shop
how
have
you
passed
the
night
sir
she
asked
rather
badly
jeanette
i
have
dreamed
continually
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
you
an
idea
of
all
the
dangers
and
precipices
which
i
thought
i
overcame
and
crossed
it
seems
to
me
that
i
went
over
the
mountain
road
which
leads
to
the
farm
but
it
was
a
very
different
road
i
dreamed
that
our
interview
was
prevented
i
do
not
know
how
and
that
i
had
a
long
walk
home
again
what
can
it
all
mean
it
is
only
the
result
of
your
wishes
and
preoccupation
in
regard
to
the
young
lady
she
will
soon
return
and
then
these
follies
will
disappear
i
very
soon
forgot
all
about
what
i
have
just
described
and
so
did
my
servant
for
neither
of
us
attached
any
importance
to
a
dream
but
after
a
short
time
a
messenger
from
the
farm
handed
me
a
letter
in
which
my
fiance
reproached
me
for
my
violence
my
bad
conduct
and
disobedience
in
going
there
in
defiance
of
the
commands
and
wishes
of
her
father
what
i
no
never
tell
your
mistress
that
although
i
have
thought
of
going
to
see
her
i
have
never
carried
out
my
desires
if
i
have
not
done
so
it
has
not
been
through
lack
of
courage
and
will
on
my
part
but
only
because
of
my
desire
to
please
her
and
not
to
oppose
her
wishes
but
we
saw
you
me
yes
siryou
you
are
telling
an
untruth
i
have
not
been
out
my
servant
can
corroborate
that
and
further
i
have
nothing
to
lose
by
telling
the
truth
that
may
be
as
you
please
but
it
is
true
that
you
spoke
to
me
you
questioned
me
on
the
subject
of
mademoiselledesired
me
to
tell
her
that
you
were
there
and
wished
to
speak
to
her
these
are
illusions
on
your
part
you
have
been
dreaming
that
is
possible
but
there
were
two
three
all
the
servants
who
also
saw
you
you
did
not
arrive
until
nearly
midnight
you
were
dressed
as
you
are
now
and
riding
a
white
horse
which
you
fastened
to
the
gnarled
oak
we
could
all
recognise
you
by
the
moonlight
and
you
were
going
towards
the
side
door
when
i
stopped
you
from
entering
hearing
our
voices
the
dogs
began
to
bark
which
caused
all
the
servants
to
get
up
you
were
recognised
by
my
master
and
the
young
lady
who
fell
on
her
knees
before
her
father
beseeching
him
not
to
fire
on
you
without
showing
any
fear
you
returned
step
by
step
to
your
horse
and
went
down
the
mountain
again
my
master
was
much
annoyed
with
you
called
his
confidential
servant
marino
ordered
him
to
follow
you
and
not
to
be
afraid
but
to
fire
on
you
two
or
three
times
as
he
would
be
responsible
marino
set
out
and
although
he
walked
quickly
and
tried
all
he
could
to
catch
you
up
he
could
not
do
so
a
curious
phenomenon
aroused
his
attention
which
was
that
he
always
saw
you
going
at
the
same
pace
and
he
had
not
the
courage
to
fire
his
rifle
you
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
about
five
oclock
in
the
morning
the
moon
was
setting
and
the
day
commencing
to
break
before
you
arrived
at
the
first
crossing
of
the
streets
you
began
to
run
and
turned
quickly
along
the
first
street
in
the
town
and
though
marino
ran
after
you
he
lost
sight
of
you
at
the
next
crossing
my
persecutor
frightened
by
what
he
had
seen
returned
immediately
to
the
farm
to
inform
his
master
of
what
had
taken
place
and
which
seemed
very
extraordinary
and
supernormal
for
a
long
time
this
adventure
of
which

a
great
stir
in
the
town
colonel
de
rochas
a
distinguished
french
savant
has
made
this
question
of
the
externalisation
or
projection
of
the
double
and
of
the
motricity
and
sensibility
of
the
subject
his
special
and
patient
study
and
has
embodied
the
results
of
many
of
his
experiments
in
separate
works
some
have
also
been
published
in
the
pages
of
the
annals
of
psychical
science
so
that
the
reader
who
is
particularly
interested
in
the
question
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
material
for
further
consideration
and
study
the
socit
magntique
de
france
has
also
conducted
extensive
experiments
in
this
field
of
research
particulars
of
which
are
published
from
time
to
time
in
the
journal
du
magntisme
the
following
theoretical
explanation
given
at
the
conclusion
of
the
report
of
a
series
of
these
experiments
is
reprinted
from
the
annals
for
julyseptember
we
know
that
the
phantom
is
the
psychical
body
projected
from
the
physical
body
it
is
that
which
enjoys
or
suffers
thinks
wishes
judges
and
perceives
all
sensations
it
is
constantly
animated
by
extremely
rapid
vibratory
movements
which
are
certainly
the
same
as
when
it
is
within
the
body
this
principle
being
admitted
we
understand
that
when
it
animates
the
body
its
vibratory
movements
are
not
projected
outside
and
that
it
exercises
no
appreciable
action
on
other
organisms
in
its
neighbourhood
but
when
it
is
outside
the
body
its
movements
are
easily
externalised
then
the
phantom
and
another
person
vibrating
in
unison
represent
two
stringed
instruments
which
sound
at
the
same
time
when
one
only
is
touched
if
i
can
obtain
this
transmission
at
great
distances
we
can
explain
this
strange
and
unexpected
phenomenon
by
the
theory
of
wireless
telegraphy
or
telephony
the
results
of
the
many
experiments
conducted
by
and
under
the
auspices
of
french
scientists
in
particular
tend
to
indicate
that
in
the
near
future
an
explanation
of
the
phenomena
of
vampirism
will
be
forthcoming
